I"m<p>Hello again chicos and chicas,</p>
<p align="justify">So we went through almost all the
important stuff for multiple linear regression, but I have one more for you and
then I think we might go further into developing beautiful word of analysis and
statistics ðŸ˜Š. So last for now, but not least of course:</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Model fit verification</b></p>
<p align="justify">So as in simple linear regression
we compute RSE and R<sup>2</sup> for our model â€“ here <b><a href="https://szarki9.tumblr.com/post/189023033128/how-to-measure-the-quality-of-our-model">link</a></b>
to my post explaining that.</p>
<p align="justify">R<sup>2 </sup>close to 1 will again
indicate that the model explains a lot. But what we need to remember, that R<sub>Â­Â­</sub><sup>2</sup>
will always increase when more variables will be added to the model, even if
they are not so significant. In order to see that better, we shall consider
examples, so we will, but in one of the following posts. </p>
<p align="justify">Okay, what about RSE? So formula
for that is in general given by: (RSS/(n-p-1))<sup>1/2</sup>, which in simple
linear regression case simplifies to the formula given previously. And again, deciding
what are the outcomes of RSE requires knowledge about the model itself and its
values.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p align="justify">That was quick. There are many things about the model that needs to be considered except that, but for the introduction theory, I would say that is it and further important details shall be discovered onÂ â€˜livingâ€™ examples.</p>
<p align="justify">Thank you and see you soon,</p>
<p>xoxo,</p>
