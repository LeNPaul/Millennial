I"”<p>Endotracheal tubes (ETT) are a core component of the intubation process. They consist of a PVC tube with special cuff at the end. Once positioned, the cuff is inflated to secure the tube in place. Unfortunately, when overinflated the cuff decreases blood flow to nearby tissues resulting in tracheal stenosis and tissue damage. Mettasense is a sensor which measures, records and mediates pressure within an endotracheal tube cuff. It leverages a check valve to relieve high pressure, a prominent cause of tracheal injury. Mettasense houses electrical components to constantly check cuff pressure. Dangerous deviations are caught by the device, resulting in visual and audio alarms. Mettasense adds new material to the field of tracheal research as it records and organizes all processed pressure data. Combined, it provides a platform which mediates endotracheal cuff pressure while collecting valuable data.</p>
