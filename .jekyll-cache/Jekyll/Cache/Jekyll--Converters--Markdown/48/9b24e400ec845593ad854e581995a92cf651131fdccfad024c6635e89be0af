I"®<p>Organoids are small, self-organized tissues grown from stem-cell progenitors. These <em>ex vivo</em> cultures help bridge the gap between animal models and cell culture experiments as they recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity without high cost. Organoids can be viewed via confocal microscopy and counted as a measure of stem-cell viability. This project aims to recognize and quantify intestinal organoids with YOLOv3.</p>
