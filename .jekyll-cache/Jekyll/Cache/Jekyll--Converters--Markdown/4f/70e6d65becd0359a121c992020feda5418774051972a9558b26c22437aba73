I"¯	<p>Hi there,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the last two weeks, I have been researching what
is the best and most achievable way (from my perspective ofc) to prepare
yourself to work as a data specialist. I decided to start with the interview
questions as I think they can give you quite a good overview of the skills that
you need to have at the beginning and after them, you can start developing skills in
more advanced way or make the DS portfolio. </p>
<p align="justify">There are a lot of question that you might be
asked from fields such as statistics, machine learning, data quality or data cleansing
(including use of most common python libraries), SQL query optimization and so
on. I will start with statistics â€“ that is the most basic knowledge that you
should have and will be used everywhere further. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>So let us start with the types of statistics
and what is a statistic in general?</b></p>
<p align="justify">There are two of them, <b>descriptive statistics</b>
and <b>inferential statistics</b>. I have described the first one widely a couple of
posts before. But just to recall, the descriptive statistics is used to see
tendencies (such as average, mean, std, etc.) in given data set and visualize
them (using charts). </p>
<p align="justify">Inferential statistics, on the other hand, is
much more complex, uses high mathematical solutions and works on random samples
in order to make inferences about a population. For example, having a random sample of
people and their salaries you can test whether a statement that men earn more
than women can be rejected as a hypothesis or not. We can also estimate an interval
for the value of specific parameters (mean or standard deviation). Given that,
inferential statistics can be divided into two: estimation (point estimation or
interval estimation) and hypothesis testing. I will go with specifics of each
of the statistics in later posts, but in the end I would like to highlight the fundamental
difference about them which is that you cannot make predictions out of info described
within methods from descriptive statistics because they just characterize this
specific data set that is given and these characterizations are always precise
numbers. With inferential statistics output of the considered problems is rather
a range of potential numbers with a degree of confidence.</p>
<p align="justify">Hope it clarifies a little, see you soon </p>
