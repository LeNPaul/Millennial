I"µ<p>Early in my youth, I played classical and jazz trumpet. I came to see music as a grouping of harmonic patterns whose finite details produce moving melodies. Noticing the intricacies of each piece was critical in producing powerful melodies. Once you master your part, you must listen to the surrounding context to lead and support. Occasionally, a perfect storm of variables creates magical melodies which strike emotion in those listening.</p>

<p>The music of my personal life was less harmonious. My father was injured when I was little leaving him paralyzed. When not practicing trumpet, I spent many afternoons at rehabilitation facilities playing with pieces of medical equipment. I tumbled wheelchairs and hopped on crutches as if they were stilts. These early days led me to see the many flaws of medical equipment - the extreme prices and limited durability.</p>

<p>I decided to attend the University of Utah in pursuit of a biomedical engineering degree hoping to make better, cheaper devices for the disabled population. Prior to starting school, my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her treatments ranged from cutting-edge immunotherapies to experimental clinical trails. Through her fight, I saw much of the healthcare system and witnessed a few of the grim challenges cancer patients face. Throughout this process, the head oncologist always stressed the importance data driven decision making. There was no silver bullet as cancer constantly mutates. We took this ideology to heart, letting data from genomic sequencing, novel research and experimentation guide treatment planning. When the patient is family, each decision seems monumental. [concluding sentence] The treatment space is huge though and the number of patients with similar cases is small. Eventually treatments stop working and experimental trials are more dangerous than traditional treatment.</p>

<p>This experience changed me. I began to consider the possibility of applying learned algorithms to increase lifespan while maintaining high life quality. Finding those patients with similar mutations and treatment histories greatly benefited my mother as discussions and comparison of their own data lead to effective treatments, especially when using data size was small (most often seen in clinical trials). Furthermore, it enabled connection and support, another critical element when coping with terminal illness. With this experience in hand, I began to comprehend the power of data alongside the accessible benefit it could provide to all.</p>

<p>I envision a future where personalized medicine is a harmonization of omics, exposures and genealogy. Data science will play a critical role in all areas which digest and actualize these data including detection, drug development, deployment and patient pairing. Equally import will be ethical considerations of privacy and data bias. I actively seek to build anti-racist data tools, not just when convenient, but as a critical standard for product success. I started out creating music by tuning my own playing parameters to create melodies. Now I am excited to find melodies in data, cutting through noise and evidencing lasting effects.</p>
