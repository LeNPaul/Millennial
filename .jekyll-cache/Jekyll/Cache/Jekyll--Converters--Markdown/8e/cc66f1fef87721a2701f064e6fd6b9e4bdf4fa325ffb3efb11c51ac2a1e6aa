I"Æ<p>Phragmites australis is an invasive plant species threatening the Howard Slough Waterfowl Management Area in Salt Lake City, Utah. This project, contracted by the Utah Department of Natural Resources, aimed to segment P. australis from sUAS images in order to track the growth of the plant. A U-Net architecture yielded ~86% test set pixel-to-pixel accuracy in segmenting aerial images for P. australis.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>An invasive subspecies of Phragmites australis was likely introduced to Utah in the early 1980s. Since then, it has aggressively expanded, increased fire danger and caused ecological damage. The plant grows rampant in a local wildlife reserve known as the Howard Slough Waterfowl Management Area, just north of Salt Lake City. P. Australis propogates by forming monotypic stands which harm the natural habitats of many migratory birds and shrubs.</p>

<p>The spread of P. australis decreases diversity, altering nutrient cycling and hydrology. For many years, the Utah Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has been working to remove the plant. In an effort to track the progress and effectiveness of remediation, the DNR is imaging the Howard Slough Waterfowl Management Area as they apply a pesticide. The environment is extremely difficult to navigate and requires a Marsh Master to avoid vehicles sinking into the marsh. A small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) is ideal for monitoring the situation. The sUAS is fitted with a multispectral image sensor (blue, green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared bands) and flown at a height to produce a ground sample distance of about 7.5 cm.</p>
