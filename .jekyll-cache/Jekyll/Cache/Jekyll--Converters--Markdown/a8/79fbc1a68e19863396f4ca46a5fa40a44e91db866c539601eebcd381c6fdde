I"«<p>Phragmites australis is an invasive plant species threatening the Howard Slough Waterfowl Management Area in Salt Lake City, Utah. This project, contracted by the Utah Department of Natural Resources, aimed to segment P. australis from sUAS images in order to track the growth of the plant. A U-Net architecture yielded ~86% test set pixel-to-pixel accuracy in segmenting aerial images for P. australis.
