Nice to see you all, to start with, I have just moved to Amsterdam to start my Master in Data Science at UvA. I am suuuuuper excited, that was honestly one of my dreams to study abroad someday and it is so great that I managed to achieve it. As far we have different assignments and projects so I will update you with the things that I learn :)! Today I would like to start with some brief sum-up of the things from the first week of lectures. </p>
