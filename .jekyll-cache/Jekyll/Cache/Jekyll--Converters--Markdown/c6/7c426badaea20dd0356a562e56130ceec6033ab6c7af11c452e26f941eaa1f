I"%<p>Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a carcinogenic material associated with adverse cardiovascular events and cancer incidence. In the winter, Utah experiences acute inversions which trap particulates close to the urban population. The study of these particulates are critical in helping the Utahn population properly mitigate exposure. Herein, a spatial analysis is performed on scraped, hourly PurpleAir and AirNow PM2.5 exposures from April 7th-14th. Primary findings demonstrate PurpleAir sensors to have better rural coverage and decreased accuracy when compared to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) AirNow measurements.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Salt Lake City basin is an established outdoor kingpin with a rapidly expanding technology sector. The geographic shape of the region leads to “sinkholes” of pollution with notably high concentrations of particulate matter and ozone. With reduced wind and precipitation, warm air traps pollutants in the basin resulting in high pollutant concentrations, breathable by city dwellers. These trapped toxins are dangerous to human health. Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is robustly associated with many negative disease outcomes including non-fatal heart attacks, asthma and increased cancer risk.</p>
