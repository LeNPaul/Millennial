I"|<p>Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a carcinogenic material associated with adverse cardiovascular events and cancer incidence. In the winter, Utah experiences acute inversions which trap particulates close to the urban population. The study of these particulates are critical in helping the Utahn population properly mitigate exposure. Herein, an analysis is performed on scraped, hourly Purpleair and Airnow PM2.5 exposures from April 7th-14th. Primary findings demonstrate PurpleAir sensors to have better rural coverage and decreased accuracy when compared to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Airnow measurements.</p>
