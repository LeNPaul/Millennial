I"ó<p>Hola chicos,</p>
<p align="justify">this weekend I will be a participant of a hackathon!!!
Yey, right? Honestly, I am super excited but I feel a bit unprepared. Hackathon
challenge is going to be about image processing so there is a lot to learn
about it. Iâ€™m not sure whether the problem will be given as supervised or unsupervised
but what I do know â€“ from my brief research, that I need to be acquainted with
deep learning so today I want to focus on that. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Question for today friends: what deep learning
is about?</b></p>
<p align="justify">The concept of deep learning has over 50 years
as for now, but until the second decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, there was
not enough data to use it and not strong enough processors to perform it. The
main idea behind it is to process or analyze the problem as the human brain does,
which is process it simultaneously within numerous neurons connected with each
other. And from that objective programming systems and structures (often machine
learning processes) operating on that idea are called <b>neural networks</b>. So deep learning is a part of machine learning
which is a part of artificial intelligence. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Following question arises: what is a neural
network?</b><br /></p>
<p align="justify">This is a enormous number of connected with each
other and working at the same time processors. Each processor has itâ€™s own
memory and task to do, which often might be a machine learning process. The
network learns something simple and basic at the beginning of the hierarchy and
then passes information about itâ€™s discovery to the next level. There, basic
information is combined into something more complicated and so on, until information
is processed through all hierarchy and through all processors.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Difference between Machine Learning and Deep
Learning:</b></p>
<p align="justify">As previously stated, deep learning is a part
of machine learning. But machine learning always needs to have a human operator
for providing testing examples and manually amend mistakes. What is more
machine learning is very time-consuming and it only depends on human
creativity when figuring out how to make a model better.</p>
<p align="justify">On the contrary, deep learning is mostly
perform as unsupervised learning. Raw data are provided for the model and no
more human participation is needed, as computer thinks independently and
learns. In deep learning, we are not using linear logic, as in most machine
learning problems, but layers allow the model to learn and they reorganize after
every new experience.</p>
