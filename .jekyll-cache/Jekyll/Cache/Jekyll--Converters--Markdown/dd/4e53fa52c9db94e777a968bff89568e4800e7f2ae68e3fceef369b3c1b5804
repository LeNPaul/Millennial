I"›<p>Phragmites australis is an invasive plant species threatening the Howard Slough Waterfowl Management Area in Salt Lake City, Utah. This project, contracted by the Utah Department of Natural Resources, aimed to segment P. australis from sUAS images in order to track the growth of the plant. A U-Net architecture yielded ~86% test set pixel-to-pixel accuracy in segmenting aerial images for P. australis.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>An invasive subspecies of Phragmites australis was likely introduced to Utah in the early 1980s. Since then, it has aggressively expanded, increased fire danger and caused ecological damage. The plant grows rampant in a local wildlife reserve known as the Howard Slough Waterfowl Management Area, just north of Salt Lake City. P. australis propagates by forming monotypic stands which harm the natural habitats of many migratory birds and shrubs.</p>
