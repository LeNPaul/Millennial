Hey, I'm Abe. I'm writing from Dade City Florida. I've been working with the [Dade City Church of Christ](https://dadecitychurchofchrist.com) for 4 years now. You can find my sermons here. My wife,Grace and I have been married for 6 years. We have one son.

I tend to spend my days studying alone and with others. When I'm not doing that I'll learn new things on Youtube, like building this website. I also enjoy playing with my son and reading--which is probably part of working, but I don't keep track.
Genesis is probably my favorite book of the Bible. Mark or James is probably a close second. But my favorite changes depending on what I'm studying. Though I come back to Genesis just to read it often.

My favorite work beyond the biblical writers might be the Republic of Plato. That book covers just about everything and it's hard to pin down the whole of the book, but it has great insights--which are right next to foolish ideas. Just thinking about it makes me what to go back and read it again. It's not overtly theological but it serves as a foil against the wisdom of the Scriptures.
Here at Graphite, I will contribute by managing the site and by writing on several topics. Mainly my articles will be about book reviews,piety, theology, homiletics, and some occasional spiritual commentary on the news.
