I am now writing from Cocoa, Florida having arrived here in July of 2019. Florida seems very hot, and I live in Cocoa, which only recently did it dawn on me how well this suits me. I have enjoyed “hot cocoa” for years, even in the summer!  My wife Tami and I had 4 sons in about 5 1/2 years, life has been full and fun. All my sons are now married and we have 3 grandchildren! I currently work with the [North Courtenay Church of Christ](http://www.ncourtenaychurchofchrist.com/)

I have been a full time evangelist-minister since 1984, having recently returned from the mission fields of Romania (2016-2019).  As far as hobbies go I enjoy almost all active sports, basketball, tennis, and lately running.  My favorite book of the Bible is the gospel of John because he explores the nature of Christ in vivid detail.  Outside the Bible I have repeatedly enjoyed Josephus’ “Wars of the Jews”. I have it in book and audio book form. But a close second with Josephus, would be Steven Covey’s,  “Seven Habits of Highly Effective People”. Steven is a dad’s dad.

My main contribution in writing for graphite.press will be pointing us back to Christ under various topics to reconsider our faith in him. The topics I have chosen to do most of my writing are under the categories; Shadows of Christ in the OT, Apologetics, Authority: Seeking the author’s will, The Gospel of John and the book of Revelation. If all goes well, I will seek to publish these in book form by at least 2029.
