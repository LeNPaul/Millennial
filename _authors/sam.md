I live in Baldwyn, Mississippi with my wife and daughter. I preach for the [Rienzi Church of Christ](https://rienzicoc.com/), and I also work as a Corporate Data Analyst at Relias Healthcare. 

For hobbies, I enjoy running, reading, and listening to music. To date, I have run forty-something marathons and three ultramarathons. For reading, the genres I like most are self-help, philosophical, and classical books. Only recently have I enjoyed novels. 

My favorite book of the Bible is usually whichever one I am studying at the moment. Right now my favorite is Matthew, particularly the Lord’s Sermon on the Mount, as it is what I have been studying lately. My favorite non-book of the Bible has recently been Walden by Henry David Thoreau. To pick my favorite book, I thought about a book that I've liked for more than five years, one that had a good message and was well written. This was the book I thought of. I started reading it with Julie when we were dating. Its message of living simply speaks to me personally, and Thoreau writes beautifully. 

A main goal of mine in writing for Graphite is to help the Christian to live. I write three kinds of articles toward this end. First, I will write on wellness for preachers. Second, I’ll write on topics to discourage the Christian from escaping life for “Christianity.” Third, I’ll review books by authors who write on this same theme, authors such as Soren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Percy Walker.
