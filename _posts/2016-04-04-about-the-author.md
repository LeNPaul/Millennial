Hi there! I'm Paul. I’m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Below is a compilation of some of my favourite things that I have built over the years. You may find everything else on my <a href="http://github.com/lenpaul" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/lenpaul" target="_blank">Code Pen</a> profiles.

### Jekyll Website Theme for Blogging

Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll blog theme that I built from scratch. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused blogging platform for your personal site or blog. This theme is currently being used by about three dozen people, with this number growing every day.
