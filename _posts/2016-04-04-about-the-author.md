Hi there! I'm Jonathan. A backend engineer with a focus on building ML systems. I've done everything from defining core growth metrics and calculating CAC, to leading a team of 5 ML engineers to create ML systems for healthcare, to leveraging LLMs for ranking. Feel free to reach out; I love to connect and chat!
