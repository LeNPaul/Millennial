As always, Jekyll offers support for GitHub Flavored Markdown, which allows you to format your posts using the [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Examples of these text formatting features can be seen below. You can find this post in the `_posts` directory.

### Quote Blocks

> Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so that each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry.

### Code

```js
// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console

// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments

var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
// > 8
```
