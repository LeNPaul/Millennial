“Hey there believers, it's Angel Rafael here, with another vlog post. This time I'm in The Brooklyn Public Library. It's the middle of the night. I was sent here to deliver these stone tablets with news from this one god named Rebenca. She's the one who helps you get tax breaks out of the blue. And avoid meter maids. One time she made a meter maid trip and fall while he was ticketing a person who just lost their job. That Rebenca! She watches soaps and drinks whiskey sours all day. Then goes on walks through the galactic rainforest. Rebenca helped write three of the original commandments. Oh and she gives out EXTRA GOOD multiple orgasms to everyone, male or female, who is pure of heart. She throws parties every time the moons 3 galaxies away get full, which is most months. Oh Rebenca! Always wears these wild purple velvet gowns with three gemstones dangling on each shoulder pad. This week it's rubies.'

"Rebenca wants you to know that the human race will continue to be punished with another Fifty Shades book AND movie every year as long as people keep having this problem with sexual consent. But, on a positive note, Rebenca gave you four new commandments to help y’all out.”

FIRST NEW COMMANDMENT: Thou shalt not gas light by candle light.
When you treat a basicky hipster to a night of candle-lit wining and dining, they’ll be expecting rose petals and a day in Paris. They’ll be shocked when treated like a pet in the home of a curious toddler. But you already knew that, didn’t you? Or didn’t you? Or did you? Or, didn’t you? Or didn’t you? Or did you? Or, didn’t you?

“Or didn’t you? Or did you? Or, didn’t you? That's how it is with this gaslighting malarkey. Only god knows and her name is Rebenca. It’s like you think you can hide, but then there’s a trailer for Fifty Shades before every single movie - even art movies, indy comedies, no matter the demographic. Next commandment.”

2. Straight boys, thou shalt have sex with your bros.
It’s obvious you love each other. You know that one guy, you know the one… and you know what? It doesn’t make you gay to fuck him. Brokeback Mountain was made by an all straight cast, writers and director; you don’t have to be gay in order to claim gay shit.

“I mean, it would be so hot if you two would just fuck. Give AND receive at least once in your life or you’ll plateau. But I mean take all this with a grain of salt because a word of caution - both Rebenca and I have a fatal flaw where we are queer and think everyone else is queer deep down. And that’s just plain wrong. Yet, my errant notions are not what is currently causing god’s wrath: the sex misery currently clogging up social media is the problem. Rebenca is bothered. And you don't want to know when she gets very bothered. She goes hard. Listen to Rebenca's next commandment.”

3. Thou shalt talk about what you like and dislike before, during and after sex.
Talking about what you’re into doesn’t ruin the moment. Know what you might want to do on your date and know what you absolutely will not do. What you want to do is not the same as what your date must do. Ask your date what they want. Tell them what you want. Rinse. Repeat.

“Even Fifty Shades gets that right probably. I haven’t seen any of the movies. None of us have. Just the trailers. Is it just queers, angels, demons and other supernatural creatures who can’t stand the Fifty Shades franchise? We haven’t truly considered that narrow-minded individuals might actually like Fifty Shades. It’s possible that Rebenca's punishment may not be a punishment after all. It’s like when we ejected Adam and Eve from the garden: these things backfire on us sometimes. But I mean. Nah. Fifty Shades is literally a dull porno made by cutting clips from the sad parts of a pharmaceutical commercial. Yeah, it’s a decent enough punishment that should effect change. Yeah. OK! So final commandment. And this one - I think it sucks. If I’m being honest, this one is just Rebenca making some shit up and hoping it sticks. It’s kind of like two commandments… but it’s not even a commandment like technically. I’m just asking that you don’t shoot the messenger.”

4. Assault is not your fault and thou shalt not be nice.
When going on a date, try sporting a confident, devil-may-care attitude. For femmes, the threat of being potentially tacitly under threat of a crime that is only prosecuted 1% of the time, it can be hard to feel as freewheeling as the masculine types who may never have felt threatened. Try to get into the headspace that you don’t live in a society where 1 in 6 women are victims of rape and attempted rape. You’ll find it’s a fun escape from reality. I know that’s a lot of fictionalizing, but for those of you who are good at make-believing when you’re being gaslit: why not apply your superpower to your own sexual gratification.

“You know I said, God, you are mean. Also maybe not so much stats. And then Rebenca was like, but they don’t believe in anything that isn’t evidence-based. So, she won that argument. Rebenca wins every argument, being the most usually drunk and stubborn being I have ever met. But at least she's not a borderline criminal. Anyhow, I wanted to make this one more fun like it should be so let's switch gears a lot now.'

"Guess what!? It’s time to play, ladeez! Turn the tables with a some silly lady shenanigans for once!? Amiright ladeez!? Play dress up by returning from the bathroom with a metal probe and actual shit in your hair. Your man will be attentive while pretending not to be weirded out. In other words, take control. Go gurl and other aphorisms popularized by Pinterest & Instagram and ruinously emblazoned on otherwise perfectly fine T-shirts at ROSS Dress for Less. You know what I’m talking about my biatches and bashes and beeshies my beastlettes!’

“I realize I’m not very relatable; I'm an angel. I'm here to deliver these commandments, which, I told Rebenca, is so Old Testament in a world where even the New Testament is tired. The one new thing we have is ignorant and outdated. And most people don’t even believe in anything unless it’s in the form of a popular meme. And here I am delivering stone tablets made out of stone with writing that was chiseled into them with chisels. Google stores every last tidbit we do on the internet, but one good bulldozing and these laws are toast, I told Rebenca. I’ll just leave these here, at the reference desk at the Brooklyn Public Library. You can’t check them out, but you can look at them. Maybe check the Library’s twitter feed. It should be a big deal for them. Sheesh, let’s hope it is. In closing, change your non-consensual ways, while there’s still time. Melania is currently hard at work ghost writing the next Fifty Shades franchise, but it doesn’t have to be this way. It has been decreed.”
