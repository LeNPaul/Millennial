# Five Alive
She was five, her favorite number. She was worried she wasn’t going to be able to live up to the high demands of being a six-year-old when her next birthday came. She would wake up before the sun to be alone and watch Looney Tunes every Saturday morning. When she watched “All this and Rabbit Stew” with a blackface version of Elmer Fudd she went to the kitchen and got a bag of carrots from the bottom drawer of the fridge and a knife from the wooden silverware drawer. On the sofa, she cut the carrots into disks and pretended to be boiled alive like Bugs. It was the end of the 70s and Mommie Dearest was broadcast on TV. Finding it too adult and boring, she gulped down the horribleness of it anyways. She gawked at it while pretending not to watch. Children crave campy violence since it mirrors the behind-closed-doors social interactions that aren’t openly acknowledged or processed. Children eavesdrop on their parent’s fights. Like tea leaf readers they look for signs in the nonsense for what their futures hold. In the back yard grass Lucia would brush her attack dog’s teeth. And she would pick boysenberries off the overgrown bush in the backyard while keeping an eye peeled for rats that ran from palm tree skirt to palm tree skirt via the phone wires. At night the men would share important-seeming chatter about the dangers of the rats and the men influenced one another to hire other, apartment-dwelling men to cut the palms bare to clear the rats’ nests. The rats were a nuisance to the neighborhood and threatened the safety and cleanliness we all look forward to, who live in the suburbs. A black family lived in her house before Lucia and her white family moved in. Her father got a deal on white people hate non-whites. Maybe they concoct sub-conscious or even conscious beliefs that everything black people touch has the cooties of slave ancestry. Also privileged people want no association with victims of their everyday terrorism. After the palm trunks were cut naked by the poorer men, the rats moved into the English ivy that was smothering the wooden fence. Before the rats had to move from their nests in the crispy palm fronds, Lucia kept vigilant watch for them. She brushed her dog’s teeth in the manner of [the veterinary dentist who brushed a llama’s teeth on Sesame Street. A recurring video short, educational and fascinating.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgkYHhG18uc) Except Lucia had a collection of twigs rather than professional dental tools. Neither the llama nor her dog wanted to have a person doing things to their mouth even if it was for their own good. When she would notice a rat glide by on the wire there was nothing she could do but it felt like knowing helped even if to avoid being seen. She could create a forcefield out of her stunned fear. And there’s the fact that being forewarned about creepy things helps you to be less traumatized when they do strike. But the rats always kept their distance. She watched the Secret of Nimh at her grandmother’s house two years later. Her grandmother kept her eyebrows well-arched and went to church frequently and stopped to give cash to drifters but berated the men she lived with. The Secret of Nimh was a boring and unsettling cartoon and was too grown-up for a kid to consume like cereal on Saturday morning. It was something a child secretly kept tabs on. Lucia absorbed it like her safety depended on it.
