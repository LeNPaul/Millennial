Hey there! I'm Sarah, a 19 year old from Belfast. Iâ€™m a Software Developer for a Belfast based company, and a Computing Systems Student. Ever since I first learned how to program in an after-school club, I have pursued programming out of pure curiosity, and later as a career. This blog details my life since leaving school - starting my degree, moving out on my own, and of course starting my first job as a Programmer. You can find everything else on my <a href="http://twitter.com/@SquinnieThePooh" target="_blank">twitter</a> profile.
