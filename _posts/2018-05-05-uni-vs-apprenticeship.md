As you might have guessed from the title - I haven’t followed the traditional route when it comes to my education or my career.  I’m am Apprentice Software Engineer at Kainos, a Belfast based, digital technology company. I started back in September 2017 and in the months that I’ve been at Kainos, I’ve realised how grateful I am for trusting my gut and not going to University as a full-time student. 

Just like a lot of other 18-year-olds right now, last year I was busy sorting out my university applications; I struggled to pick any particular course because I didn’t exactly know what I wanted to do. 

I had always known that I wanted a career in IT, but I had no clue if I wanted to do a general Computer Science degree or specialise in something like Software Engineering. Around the time that I was finalising my personal statement, I started browsing apprenticeships online and found a few in Belfast, that's when I found the 'Earn As You Learn' which I'm currently doing. It was an easy decision for me to submit an application because it didn’t take up space on my UCAS application which meant it was a win-win situation whether I landed a job or not.

It was scary after I got the job offer because when I was in school we were always taught that a full-time degree and a placement year, was the 'normal' thing to do once you'd got your A-Levels.

Long story short I’ve been at Kainos for 8 months now and I have no regrets; if anything I wonder why I ever doubted that an apprenticeship was the right choice for me, versus than the traditional route of full-time university, a ton of loans and crappy student houses. Even though I really do think I would have enjoyed university, I believe 100% that this is a better route, not just for me but for a lot of people, most of whom have probably never even thought about apprenticeships before.

The biggest issue that (people assume) I have, is that I lack a social life, but in reality, I’ve never been as busy. I’ve never had as many staff nights out, I’ve never had as many house parties, or as many trips to the pub, or even as many gigs with friends before. I started as an apprentice alongside 9 other people; we spent 4 weeks in training together and ever since then we’ve had a standing lunch arrangement, as well as an unspoken agreement to meet up at the monthly payday drinks in the local bar. 

In truth, what I was most afraid of was losing touch with friends and ending up feeling left out of the typical ‘student life’, but with an apprenticeship, you can still enjoy one. I get to go to university one day a week, but I also get a salary for working the other days; the best part though, is that I don’t have to worry about student loans because my employer covers my degree fees, and I don’t have to work a part-time job like most students my age, to pay for rent and afford a decent lifestyle. My weekends are my own, and I have way more free time than I thought I would (which is where I found the time to create this blog) so in a way, my only problem now is what to do with it!
