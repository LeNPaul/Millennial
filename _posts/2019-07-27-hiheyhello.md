Hi there!

<p align = "justify">For quite some time I wanted to start a blog and today during jogging I decided that this is the day I will do it haha. So here I am. </p>
<p align = "justify">To start with, my name is Kinga and I am currently a Mathematics BSc student (hopefully graduate in two months!!) and at the same time junior database developer. Right now I am 24 and this is high time to be sure in what direction you want to head to and start doing things that will help you pursue a perspective career. So I have been thinking about that for a while now and considering my university background, personal interests, and many, many others I made a decision to try myself in data science world. As a millenials and someone living in the 21st century I obtain my knowledge mostly from google, soo the internet has told me that writing a blog about things you learn is a pretty good way to start with DS :D. And this is the reason why I am here at tumblr. I want to share with you what I learn every day and how do I resolve the problems I face.</p>
<p align = "justify">Personally, I am quite an open-minded, easygoing person which tries to be impartial and not to judge people, so I will be more than glad to hear from you any feedback (either with my English skills or content I will share).</p>
<p align = "justify">In the end, every experience enriches us so let me learn here as most as I can! :) </p>

<p></p>
<p>xoxo,</p>
