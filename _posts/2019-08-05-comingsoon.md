Why does the Lord supper bother us? Whenever I see a man get up here and
lead the Lord supper, he may often make a comment like, "Let\'s make
sure we don\'t just go through the motions with this act. Let\'s make
sure we really think about what we\'re doing."

Why would you say this? Why do we feel the need to make sure we don\'t
just go through the motions so often? In some sense, it\'s almost as if
making this statement to not just go through the motions has become part
of "going through the motions" of participating in the Lord supper.
Hasn\'t it?

I think it could be because we have lost touch with the sacred. The
lord\'s supper, if there is such a thing as a sacred act, is the sacred
act of the Christian life. What we are about to do is holy. It is
supernatural. after I say these words, we will be like Moses and Aaron
and the elders of Israel who in Exodus 24 walked up the mountain and
they saw the god of Israel and they ate and drank in his presence. We
come to the table of Yahweh himself. In a world that profanes the sacred
and sanctifies the profane, you and I go against the grain of everyday
life. It is no wonder we become anxious about this act.

Part of our lesson this morning will be looking at the Corinthians who
have profane and the sacred. They have turned the lord\'s supper into
something of Pagan worship.

My lesson this morning will be much more straightforward. I want you to
hear what the Bible has to say about this act.

Of all the things we do to worship God, the Lord\'s Supper is the act of
the church assembled together. We can sing on our own, we can pray, we
could study, but this meal is the act of the whole church together.

To help us get a better grasp of the Lord's Supper we will look at the
terms describe the supper itself, the act of the supper, and the
attitude during the Supper. That will happen through moment reflecting
on the Supper before we observe it.

Let us pray:

*Gracious Father, we thank you for inviting us to your table this
morning. Jesus, we thank you for your sacrifice. We ask that you shape
us into instruments of praise and devotion. Purge us of evil. Bring us
into your presence. Amen.*

# Understanding the Lord's Supper By Its Terms

The number 8 special significance to early church. They saw the
resurrection Sunday as the 8th day of creation. In that spirit, we will
examine 8 terms to describe the lord\'s supper. Will spend more time on
some but focusing on each of these helps us see the Lord supper as a
whole.

## Lord's Supper (1 Cor. 11:20)

The first term of course is in fact **Lord Supper**. This is the term we
most often to describe this event. We get this term from 1st Corinthians
11: 20, where Paul says,

> **1 Corinthians 11:20**
>
> 20 When you come together, it is not the **Lord's supper** that you
> eat.

As Paul helps the Corinthians understand their abuses of this supper he
contrasts it with their own supper or meal, and the supper of the Lord.
During this time, the Corinthians would eat a full meal during the
assembly blending a common meal with the Lord\'s Supper. Paul wanted to
put a stop to that.

The Lord\'s supper is not a common meal. It is not a meal in the
physical sense. Yes, there is a literal piece of bread here, and a
literally cup. But this reflects a deeper reality. When we eat this
bread and drink this cup, we gain spiritual nourishment. Do not partake
of the Lord supper appropriately leaves us weak and sick as Paul points
out v30.

## Eucharist (Mt 26.27; Mk. 14.23; Lk 22.17; 1 Cor 11.24)

The next term is when we hardly use, but it was the most common term
used by the early church. It is the term **Eucharist**. Now, I know many
of us would not use this term because it is not a term found in
scripture. As we say we like to "*call Bible things by Bible names*."
The problem with this statement is the word *Bible* is not used in the
*Bible*. Jason Longstreth commenting about this said,

> The next time you're in a **church building**, during a **worship
> assembly**, maybe even during a **gospel meeting**, you may need to
> **come forward** while the **song leader** leads the **invitation
> song** after the **sermon** and repent of not being biblical about
> your terminology. There were 8 terms there not used in the bible,
> including the word biblically.

The word **Eucharist** comes from the Greek word for **giving thanks**.
*Eucharisteo*. That\'s all it is, a the noun form of the verb **giving
thanks**. What is interesting, is that in all 4 accounts of the Lord's
Supper there is a **giving thanks**. John\'s gospel does not record the
Lord supper, but Matthew, Mark, Luke, and first Corinthians all use this
phrase give thanks.

When we celebrate this meal together, we cannot but help **thank** God
or they gift his son for our Salvation. In America, we celebrate the
holiday Thanksgiving in November. But in Christianity, we celebrate
Thanksgiving, or the Eucharist every week together.

## Communion (1 Cor 10.16-17)

The next term will look at is the term **communion**. This comes from
1st Corinthians 10:16-17

> **1 Corinthians 10:16--17 (ESV) **
>
> **16** The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in
> the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a
> **participation** in the body of Christ?
>
> **17** Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for
> we all partake of the one bread.

The ESV does not use the word **communion** here, but **participation**.
If you have the KJV, it'll say communion. If you have a different
version, it may even say fellowship. Our theme this year is focused on
the Acts2:42 where the church devoted themselves to the apostles
teaching, **fellowship**, breaking bread, and prayer.

When we come to the table of the Lord, we are in fellowship with him. We
commune with him. The word commune often connotes the idea of communing
with supernatural beings, demons. And one of the issues the Corinthians
had was this very thing. They tried to commune with both the Lord and
demons. Look at 1 Cor. 10:22

> **1 Corinthians 10:21 (ESV) **
>
> **21** You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You
> cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.

We forsake our allegiance to any other being in the universe to solely
have fellowship with the Son. Before Jesus left this earth, he said to
the disciples , "and lo, I\'m with you always, even to the end of the
age." Do not miss the fact that Jesus is here with us right now. He\'s
not only watching us partake of his supper, but also he is looking at
our hearts.

## Breaking Bread (Acts 2.42; 20.7, 11; 27.35)

The next term is a difficult one because it can be used in more than one
way. **Breaking bread** can either mean simply sharing a meal, or more
specifically, the lord\'s supper itself. When I introduced Acts 2:42 is
our theme I noted that the breaking of bread could be either of these.

Luke will use this term often throughout the book of acts. In Acts 20:7,
we find the early Christians meeting on the first day of the week to
break bread.

> **Acts 20:7 (ESV) **
>
> **7** On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to
> break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next
> day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight.

Here the language of the assembly is used, "we were gathered together".
That is the same language in 1^st^ Corinthians 11:17.

> **1 Corinthians 11:17 (ESV) **
>
> **17** But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because
> when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.

## Memorial (1 Cor. 11.24, 26)

The next term is memorial. We get this from first Corinthians 11:24, 26

> **1 Corinthians 11:24, 26 (ESV) **
> **24** and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is
> my body, which is for you. Do this **in remembrance** of me."

"In remembrance" is a noun. An alternative translation would be, do this
memorial of me." One of the struggles we might have when coming to the
Lord supper is whether or not to be happy or sad. As we remember the
death of Jesus we are sad, as you remember his resurrection, we are
happy.

However, we do not celebrate the Lord's Supper on Thursday. We celebrate
the Lord supper on Sunday, the day the Lord came back from the dead. The
day we celebrate shows us we remember not just his death but really his
resurrection.

## Covenant Meal (1 Cor 10.21)

In first Corinthians 10 21, we find this is a covenant meal.

> **1 Corinthians 10:21 (ESV) **
> 21. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You
> cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.

This side the being at the table of the Lord brings us back to exit 24 ,
when during the first covenant God made with his people the leaders sit
and eat with God. Let\'s read that Exodus 24:7-11.

> **Exodus 24:7--11 (ESV) **
>
> 7. Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of
> the people. And they said, "All that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has spoken
> we will do, and we will be obedient."
> 8. And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said,
> "Behold the blood of the covenant that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has made
> with you in accordance with all these words."
> 9. Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of
> Israel went up,
> 10. and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were
> a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.
> 11. And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of
> Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.

When Jesus poured out the fruit of the vine for his disciples. He says
to them wat? "*This cup is the covenant in my blood*." At the table of
the Lord, the disciples saw the God of Israel just as Moses and the
others did.

And one day, we look forward to that day when we see him.

## Sacrifice (Mt. 26.25; Isa 53.12)

> **Matthew 26:28 (ESV) **
>
> 28 for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many
> for the forgiveness of sins.

Jesus' blood was for our sins. He is able to forgive them.

## Feast (1 Cor. 5.8)

> **1 Corinthians 5:8 (ESV) **
>
> **8** Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old
> leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread
> of sincerity and truth.

If you ever wondered why we use unleavened bread when we partake of the
Lord supper, this is why. Paul refers to the unleavened bread of this
Lord supper.

# Understanding by the act (External)

When we come to the Table, we bless the bread and cup. Look at the words
of Paul.

> **1 Timothy 4:4--5 (ESV) **
>
> **4** For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be
> rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
>
> **5** for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.

As we pray, we sanctify the bread in the Cup. We set them apart for this
meal. Something happens when we pray for this supper.

in the same way, the corinthian\'s were not allowed to participate in
the idolatress feasts of their gods. This is one of the issues Paul
tackles in the book of first Corinthians. they\'re eating at the feasts
of the gods.

In 1^st^ Corinthians 8 and 10 Paul argues against participation in the
feasts, but allows eating the meat sacrificed to idols after the feasts
are over. He does say it was a religious test not to eat the meat.

Christians are not allowed to participate in the idolatrous feasts of
the pagans, Because our legions is to the Lord. We share in his supper,
and no one else's.


## Self-Examination

> **1 Corinthians 11:28--30 (ESV) **
>
> 28 Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and
> drink of the cup.
>
> 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and
> drinks judgment on himself.
>
> 30 That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.


# Meditation

> **Luke 22:7--23 (ESV) **
> 7. Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb
> had to be sacrificed.
> 8. So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover
> for us, that we may eat it.
> 9. They said to him, "Where will you have us prepare it?"
> 10. He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered the city, a man
> carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that
> he enters
> 11. and tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where
> is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
> 12. And he will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare it
> there."
> 13. And they went and found it just as he had told them, and they
> prepared the Passover.
> 14. And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with
> him.
> 15. And he said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover
> with you before I suffer.
> 16. For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the
> kingdom of God."
> 17. And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, "Take
> this, and divide it among yourselves.
> 18. For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of
> the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
> 19. And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and
> gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do
> this in remembrance of me."
> 20. And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup that
> is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.
> 21. But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
> 22. For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that
> man by whom he is betrayed!"
> 23. And they began to question one another, which of them it could be
> who was going to do this.
