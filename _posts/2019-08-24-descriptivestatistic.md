<p>Hola hola mis amigos,</p><p align="justify">Hope you are having great Saturday. Mine
is partly with statistics so I would like to share with you some things that I
have learned so far and their application. I am rather pragmatic so this is why
I am paying attention to the application every time :D. As much as I like
theoretical approach and mind exercises, being able to use the things you know
is a great experience and I am always very excited when it happens to me hah.
Okay after this brief introduction let’s focus on today’s topic: statistics!</p><p align="justify">Statistics is a mathematics discipline
that provides tools to interpret observations about some quality/qualities
described within a random sample. We might consider the distribution of this
sample and some characteristics that will highlight for us some interesting
values. For example, we can consider a sample of n random people where all of
them are football players and we can analyze their height or weight or BMI and
their goal stats and see whether can we say something about the dependence
between those qualities or not.</p><p align="justify">Most basic field of the statistic is
descriptive statistics. In general, we have some data that we want to visualize
or we want to extract from them some characteristics. Visualizing data can be
done by bar charts, pie charts or any time of charts – but this is trivial, all
of you know that already :D. What I want to mention more widely is characteristics
for that data and random samples. So we have a couple of types of
characteristics:</p><p><b align="justify">Measures of central tendency</b> (measures of location) </p><p align="justify">They respond to the question what is the
most typical value for that sample? And we consider as a central tendency
measure:</p><p align="justify"><b>Arithmetic Mean</b>, pros: equal worth for each
value, lack of promotion, cons: lack of resistance for outliers. <b>Median</b>, pros: resistance for outliers,
cons: not taking under consideration values a bit further from the median. <b>Mode</b> – the most common appearing
observation. <b>Truncated</b> <b>Mean</b> – arithmetic mean but without k-observations
from each side from the ordered sample. <b>Winsorized
Mean</b> – arithmetic mean but we replace k-observations from each side with k
observation for the left side and n-k observation for the right side. <b>Weighted Arithmetic Mean, Geometric Mean</b>
(the n-th root of the product of each of n values from the sample), <b>Harmonic Mean</b> (a multiplicative inverse
of the arithmetic mean of the multiplicative inverse of the values). </p><p>And others such as quantiles (<b>quartiles</b> – division by 4, <b>deciles</b> – division by 10 and <b>percentiles</b> – division by 100)</p><p><b>Measures of dispersion</b></p><p>They respond to the question of how typical
is a typical value for that sample?</p><p align="justify"><b>Range</b> – just distance between last
and first value in the ordered sample. <b>Interquartile</b>
<b>Range</b> – which is IQR=Q3-Q1, the difference
between third and first quartile, pros: resistance for outliers,  <b>Quarter
Deviation</b> is an IQR/2. <b>Variance for
random sample</b> – tells how averagely data are inclined from the mean (expected value).
<b>Standard Deviation</b> -  square root of the variance, <b>Coefficient of Variation</b> – the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean,
shows the extent of the variability in relation to the mean of the population, <b>MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)</b> – this is
median of the absolute deviations from the data’s median, pros: more resilient to
outliers then standard deviation.</p><p align="justify"><b>Measures of the shape </b></p><p align="justify"><b>Skewness</b> – there are different
formulas, but in general it relates to the symmetry of the distribution and
distribution of a random variable about its mean. <b>Kurtosis</b> -  similar to
skewness, it is a descriptor of the shape of a probability distribution, it helps
to see how far a distribution deviates from normal.</p><p align="justify">Btw I am still working on the approach to
this super, knowledge-sharing posts so if you have any thoughts on that I will
appreciate them! Thanks, guyz,</p><p><br></p><p>xoxo,</p><p>szarki9</p>
