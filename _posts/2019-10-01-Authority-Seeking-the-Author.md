The lack of respect to the proper authority has caused severe problems since at least the beginning of the church. If we peel back this disrespect for proper authority, we would find underneath, human pride residing in the heart as the core problem. The person who fully addressed this problem was "meek and lowly”, and he “humbled himself” to a death on the cross. He never had a problem with understanding or submitting to the authority of “a Caiaphas”, “a Pilate”, or “a heavenly Father”. I believe a careful study of Jesus, noting the principles that he lived by and taught will answer most of our modern day religious problems of authority. His example and his teaching are one, having his humble heart as the common source for both.

I realize that some will object to my main thesis, that nearly all the modern day religious problems of authority could be solved by a study of authority which is based upon Christ and his teaching. But they often fail to see that Jesus faced these same issues in his life. If Jesus successfully dealt with all the problems between the authority of the Pharisees, Sadducees, Pilate (the State) and scribes of his day, then Jesus is worth more than a second look. He is worth a detailed look into how he handled these authority problems. Besides the religious division problem of his day, did he not have to accurately read the Law and the Prophets and apply what he read to his life? 

Surely the average Jew of Nazareth might well be so discouraged with the divisions among the Jews that he might just give up and say, “what’s the use, they all can’t be right.” Yet Jesus humbly found a way to be pleasing to God every day. For Jesus said, “And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him" (John 8:29 ESV)”. So this pleasing behavior of Jesus before his heavenly Father will be the basis of these articles. 

The questions raised about authority and the issues around it will be answered by observing Christ’s authority and example first and foremost in his own life. If Jesus pleased the Father in heaven in all things, then we can also. He is the way.

How well did Jesus please the author behind the text of the Old Testament? What we usually mean by respecting “authority” often boils down to respecting the author behind the rules. For example if we disrespect the rules of a boss, we are disrespecting the boss. This is also true of parents, school teachers, laws of the land or God himself. Many times I brought this up in Romania where one person’s repeated answer was, “Jesus used cheat codes” to pass his tests and go on to the next level (like a video game). 

Cheat codes often allows a player to skip one level in a video game or at least skip the difficulty he can’t seem to overcome at the moment. My reply to my Romanian friend then and now is this, “of all you know about Jesus, the way he lived his life, if Jesus actually had cheat codes for the human existence/game, would he have used them for his own benefit? Who is the real Jesus? 

Because the Jesus that I know was about the age of 30 (Luke 3:23), when he was anointed with the full measure of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; John 3:34), would not use the power of the Holy Spirit (cheat codes per say) for his own benefit. He would not even turn a stone into bread even if his life depended on it (Matt. 4:1-11). 

The only “cheat codes” that Jesus used was scripture; “it is written” three times (Matt. 4:4, 7, 10). And like cheat codes, Jesus applied the Scriptures correctly each time and won against the true enemy. The Holy Scriptures are not cheat codes, but they will help you get to the next level of pleasing the author. It’s an open book test.

As the above paragraph reveals, I am absolutely opposed to the idea that, “because Jesus is God he therefore had it easier”. On the contrary, he faced the most temptation of anyone for at least two reasons. The first reason, C.S. Lewis reminds us, that we who faced ninety percent of a temptation and then eventually fall will never know the difficulty of the last 10 percent of that temptation.[^1] 

Jesus played by his own rules, as it is said of him, “...who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.” (Heb. 4:15 ESV). Secondly, Jesus not only was willing to keep every commandment, but also to fulfill all the prophecies about himself suffering and dying. It is difficult to imagine Jesus reading Isaiah.53, Psalms 22, knowing that he was going to obey these prophecies shortly (Matt 26:54; Luke 22:37, John 15:25). Jesus obeyed all the commandments and prophecies, without any cheat codes except his use of the scriptures. After making it to the next level, he then turns around and says, "follow me," demonstrating that he believes we can follow without cheat codes.

If you are already convinced that Jesus did not use cheat codes, other than the scriptures themselves, then you have at your disposal what he had. If Jesus cheated as a man, then you can cheat. If Jesus did not cheat, then you cannot cheat. I am convinced that Jesus never cheated… never. So what do authority-cheaters look like?
