I had become a Christian about 2 months earlier, back in 1981, and I was driving back home. I had a lot on my mind and was alone in my truck. I was looking up occasionally and praying. Jesus said “watch and pray”, and I found myself watching, praying and driving. I wanted to see a sign from God. Then suddenly the truck began to shake and my heart began to pound. I pulled over and kept looking up thinking “this must be the end”. After 30 seconds I realized it was a sign; it was a sign I was out of gas. I had bought the truck just a week or two earlier, basically a gift from my neighbor Chuck. He told me that when it read 1/4 left in the tank it was actually empty. I forgot.

But for many months to come I really wanted God to do a sign through me so that I might show my neighbors the truth about how to become a disciple of Christ. I just wanted them to see it. Why could they not see what I could see so clearly? I thought if God would show them a sign through me, then that would settle it in their mind. I realize now I was wrong on several things.

How did Jesus respond? “Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.” But He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign…” (Matt. 12:38-39). Ouch! When I read that I found myself on the wrong side of Jesus, for I was seeking a sign too. And in case I did not get it the first time, I read further in Matthew "...An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign…” (Matt. 16:1-4)[^1].

Jesus obviously refused to do a sign when they demanded one and scolded them when they asked for one. I stopped asking for signs eventually. I came to understand that I, as a 21st century reader, I have the advantage over those who saw the signs of Jesus. The Holy Spirit has shown me a better way.

In the Gospel of John he shows me how powerless signs were and he gave me a better way to look at the signs Jesus performed. After John records seven public signs in the presence of his disciples, he summarizes how powerless the signs of Jesus were to overcome darkness or bias. If that last statement sounds off to you, listen carefully to the summary of John. This is his comment, his signs-in-a-nutshell statement: “But though He had performed so many signs before them, yet they were not believing in Him.” (John 12:37). John simply destroys my earlier assumption. I really thought a sign would convert my friends, family, and neighbors. I was wrong. Jesus did so many signs but these were powerless to get some to believe[^2]. Granted there is more to be said here, but I will save that for another time. Now for a better way to look at signs.

John’s paradox. _Seeing_ many signs did not cause them to believe in him[^3], but _writing_ about those same signs does[^4]? How does that work? There are at least two reasons why this works. The first is that John shows us how to look at signs in a better way. The second one is John shows us multitudes of multitudes, including himself, believe before ever seeing a sign. When we read of others believing in Jesus without needing to actually see a sign, we finally arrived among those who are truly blessed (John 20:29). Once you begin to look for these in the gospel of John, you begin to see John’s point. In these series of articles we are going to build on this theme. I do not plan on doing a full commentary on John’s gospel, but I do want to build and expand this theme that John placed before us. I can’t wait until we “see it”.
    
A better way. John uses the word sign (σημεῖον) in his book to describe the supernatural acts of Jesus. This is a common Greek word for “sign” and the Greeks used this word much like we used this word in our English language. If you see a sign while driving on the highway that says, “Rest area 1 mile”. You do not stop near the sign and stand under it, the sign simply points you to something greater than the sign itself. You drive to where the sign was pointing, park your car and rest. Jesus is greater than his signs, and they all point to him, the true resting place.
    
Signs are like business cards of Jesus. Today I will pull out of my pocket and hand someone a business card, an identical card each time. Dull and boring are my business cards, but they give factual information were I can be reached. When Jesus does a sign, he is handing out a business card. They are beautiful and full of glory, and each one showing something about Jesus. Each business card points back to him. John records 7[^5] public business cards of Jesus for us in detail, but they all point to Jesus. If you are going to come to Jesus you must leave the sign and do business with Jesus himself. You will do business with him at the cross, a theme John will develop for us.

Why did John tell us the water to wine was the first sign? Why is this important to John’s story? Why did John tell us when Jesus healed the nobleman’s son was the “second” sign? Is this trivia? It is time to stop looking for signs, and start seeing what the signs mean.

[^2]: Nicodemus did not believe though he profess to do so (John 3:2 profession 3:12 Jesus negates it), Nicodemus seems to be in darkness (John 3:1,19-21). John 6:26, 36; 7:31-32, 9:16, 12:42-43 etc.
