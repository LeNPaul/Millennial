<p>Hola, hola.</p><p align="justify">As another part of my studying
experience I want to sum up my weekend entertainment, which is learning R.
This sum up is going to be in the form of a note with links to documentation.</p><p align="justify"><b>First of all, let me tell you what R is.</b></p><p align="justify">R is a programming language (interpreted
language, which is a language that for most of the implementations execute
instructions without previously compiling a program), created in the 90s for
data analysis and as a teaching aid for learning statistics. As it was an open-source project, R easily became popular and even now many users are engaged
into developing R and in working on new packages and libraries. Thanks to that,
R has a lot of useful functions and is used for statistical calculations, data
visualization, data analysis and data science.</p><p align="justify"><b>Data types, objects:</b></p><p align="justify">Basic object type in R is a vector.
Elements of the vector have the same data type, one of the following: numeric,
integer, character or logical. Except vectors we have matrix, data frame, and list.</p><p align="justify">Matrix – all of the columns must
have the same type and same length.</p><p align="justify">Data Frames – used for storing
data tables, and it is a list of vectors with equal length, columns might have
different data type.</p><p align="justify">List – object that contains
element of different types.</p><p align="justify">Factors – used to represent
categorical data, are stored as integers and have labels associated with these
unique integers, R sorts levels in alphabetical order.</p><p align="justify">Arrays – object that can store
data in more than two dimensions.</p><p align="justify">Tibble - is a data frame
providing a nicer printing method, useful when working with large data sets.</p><p><b>Useful functions: </b></p><p align="justify"><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/class">class()</a>
- will return in a class of the object, <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/names">names()</a>
- will assign names to values of the vector/colnames and rownames accordingly
for matrices, <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/cbind">cbind()</a>
– adding new vector to matrix or merging matrices, by columns ,<a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/cbind">rbind()</a>
– combines vector, martix, data frame by row, <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/levels">levels()</a>,
<a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/summary">summary()</a>,
<a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.1/topics/str">str()</a>
- display the structure of an arbitrary R object, <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.1/topics/head">head()</a>.</p><p><b>LIBRARIES worth to know:</b></p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.2.1">ggplot2</a></b>
– data visualization package and „most elegant and aesthetically pleasing
graphics framework available in R”.</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8">dplyr</a>
- </b>is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs
that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges (like select,
mutate, filter, arrange, %&gt;% !pipelines!).</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.3.1">readr</a></b>
– provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and
fwf) (read_csv, read_tsv, read_delim etc.)</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readxl/versions/1.3.1">readxl</a></b>
– makes it easy to get data out of Excel and into R, has no external
dependencies and is designed to work with tabular data (read_excel,
excel_sheets etc.)</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/XLConnect/versions/0.2-15">XLConnect</a></b>
– comprehensive and cross-platform R package for manipulating Microsoft Excel
files from within R.</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/DBI/versions/0.5-1">DBI</a></b>
– a database interface definition for communication between R and relational
database management systems.</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/httr/versions/1.4.1">httr</a>
</b>– useful tools for working with HTTP organized by HTTP verbs (GET(),
POST(), etc). Configuration functions make it easy to control additional
request components (authenticate(), add_headers() and so on).</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/jsonlite/versions/1.6">jsonlite</a></b>
– a fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the web.</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/haven/versions/2.2.0">haven</a></b>
– enables R to read and write various data formats used by other statistical
packages (SAS, SPSS, STATA).</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/foreign/versions/0.8-72">foreign</a></b>
– another package to read and write data formats such as SAS, SPSS, STATA.</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3">tidyr</a></b>
- the goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data, functions such as gather,
spread, separate, unite, extract.</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lubridate/versions/1.7.4">lubridate</a></b>
– provides easy and fast parsing of date-times, simple functions to get and set
components of a date-time help to handle time zones (y, m, d, h, m, s)</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stringr/versions/1.4.0">stringr</a></b>

representations and API design, such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr,
tibble, haven, stringr.</p><p><br></p><p align="justify">Todo for now, will get to you with more soon!</p><p><br></p><p>szarki9</p>
