<p>Oh god hi,</p><p align="justify">that is going to be my last post
about an intro to R. This one will be more theoretical and I will try to cover the data cleaning process, approach to variables and sampling when performing
studies. So let me start with… :)</p><p><b>DATA CLEANING </b></p><p align="justify">1.<b>Exploring raw data:</b> <b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/class">class</a></b>,

values, each value belongs to a variable and an observation, a variable
contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes. </p><p align="justify"><b>Symptoms of messy data</b>: Multiple
values stored in one column, a single observational unit is stored in multiple
tables, column headers are values, not variable names. </p><p align="justify"><b>Tidyr</b>: <b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/gather">gather</a>
</b>when columns are not variables and we want to collapse them into key-value
pairs, <b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/spread">spread</a></b>
takes key-value pairs and spreads them across multiple columns, <b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/separate">separate</a></b>
separate one columns into multiple columns, <b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/unite">unite</a></b>
takes multiple columns and pastes them together.</p><p align="justify">3.<b>Preparing data for analysis:</b> type conversions
using as.*(), using a combination of y,m,d,h,m,s to parse char to date, strings

boxplot</a></b>.</p><p align="justify"><b>DATA in R</b></p><p align="justify"><b>Types of variables:</b></p><p align="justify"><b>numerical</b> – numerical values, might be continuous (often measured,
like weight) or discrete (often counted, as a number of cars).</p><p align="justify"><b>categorical</b> – limited numbers of distinct categories, might be
ordinal (finite number of values within a given range, often measured, like socio
economic status („low income”, „middle income”, „high income”)) or simply
categorical (like whether you are a vegan or not).</p><p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/table">table</a></b>,
<b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/droplevels">droplevels</a></b>
drops empty levels from the data frame.</p><p align="justify"><b>Discretize variable:</b> converting a numerical variable to a
categorical variable based on the searching criteria, e.g. adding a new variable
to dataset where 1 corresponds to value bigger than average income and 0
corresponds to value lower than average income, we can do it using <b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/mutate">mutate</a></b>
from dplyr library.</p><p align="justify"><b>Observational studies and experiments: </b></p><p align="justify"><b>Observational study</b>: collect data in a way that does not directly
interfere with how the data arise, only correlation can be inferred.</p><p align="justify"><b>Experiment study:</b> randomly assign subjects to various treatments,
causation can be inferred.</p><p align="justify"><b>Example</b>: drinking beetroot juice and physical capacity</p><p align="justify">So in the observational study, we will
select two groups of people, the ones that drink beetroot juice and the ones
that does not and then we will compare the physical capacity results for both
groups.</p><p align="justify">In the experiment study, we will sample
a group people of the population and then we will split them into a group that
will drink beetroot juice and the ones that won't (decision of drinking is
imposed by the researchers) and then after a while, we will compare the result
of physical capacity for both of the groups.</p><p align="justify">When we will find a difference in the observational study, we cannot assign the result only to beetroot juice as they
might be other variables responsible for the result and e.g. people drinking the
juice might be also the ones that practice more or eat more healthy in general.</p><p align="justify">Also in the experimental study, when
we select a random sample out of the population, these additional variables that
we did not take under account in the observational study will be equally distributed
with that random sample so when we will find a difference in the physical capacity we
might do a causal statement that drinking beetroot roots affect physical
capacity.</p><p align="justify"><b>Random sampling and random assignments:</b></p><p>Random sampling – subjects are
being selected for a study, and they are selected randomly, helps
generalizability results.</p><p align="justify">Random assignments – only in
experimental studies, where we assign subjects to various treatments, helps
infer causation from results.</p><p align="justify"><b>Simpson’s paradox</b></p><p align="justify">Explanatory variables – x and
response variable – y, might be multivariate relationship. </p><p align="justify">Example: study results as a
response and number of books read, exercises done, lecture attendance as a
explanatory variables.</p><p align="justify">By Simpson’s paradox, we call the incident
when the inclusion of the third variable in the analysis might change previously
found the outcome and relationship between the explanatory variable and a response. </p><p align="justify">Example: The study shows that more
men then women were accepted to universities, but when looking into each of the
departments, women were usually accepted at a rate higher than men. Why is that?
Because women tend to apply for the departments that have harder admission criteria
and they admit fewer people.</p><p align="justify"><b>SAMPLING STRATEGIES:</b></p><p align="justify"><b>Simple random sampling:</b> we randomly select a sample from the
population so each case is likely to have similar attributes. Example: taking a random sample of dog owners.</p><p align="justify"><b>Stratified sampling:</b> we divide the population into a homogenous group
called strata, and then we randomly sample from each of the strata. Example: if
we want to have people from each of the education classes, we divide them into strata
for each class and then randomly sample from each of the education classes.</p><p align="justify"><b>Cluster sampling</b>: we divide a population into clusters, then randomly
select a few clusters and then sample all observation within these clusters, clusters
are heterogeneous within themselves, and each cluster is similar to the other.
Example: An NGO wants to create a sample of girls across 5 neighboring towns to
provide education. Using single-stage cluster sampling, the NGO can randomly
select towns (clusters) to form a sample and extend help to the girls deprived
of education in those towns.</p><p align="justify"><b>Multistage sampling</b>: we divide a population to clusters, randomly
sample a few clusters and then we randomly sample observations from those clusters.</p><p align="justify">Sampling in R: <b><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/sample">sample_n</a></b>
from dplyr.</p><p align="justify"><b>PRINCIPLES OF EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:</b></p><p><b>1.</b><b>Control:</b>
compare the treatment of interest to a control group</p><p align="justify"><b>2.</b><b>Randomize:</b>
randomly assign subjects to treatments</p><p align="justify"><b>3.</b><b>Replicate:</b>
collect a sufficient large sample within a study, or replicate the entire study</p><p align="justify"><b>4.</b><b>Block:</b>
account for the potential effect of confunding variables (first we group
subjects into blocks based on these variables and then we randomize within each
block to treatment groups)</p><p align="justify">Okay, that one was long one :D. Hope it is clear, have a good night all!</p><p>xoxo,</p><p>szarki9</p>
