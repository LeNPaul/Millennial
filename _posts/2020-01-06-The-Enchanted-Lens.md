Psalm 104:13

Suppose a child of three or four, staring out his window to a rainstorm, asked you,
"Where does rain come from?" What would you answer? How you answer that question
shows about your worldview. There are many ways to answer this question. Even
many truthful ways. However, we must ask; how can I glorify God most by my
answer? To answer this question of a question, we turn to Psalm 104.

Psalm 104 gives us a lens with which we look at the world. Psalm 104, being Holy
Scripture, must shape how we look at the world.

The Eyes of Psalm 104
=====================

This Psalmist combs through the world with eyes lit up with wonder. To him the
world makes sense. There is a reason for the world. Order abounds. This world
has order for one reason.

Who gives, causes, sends, and waters?
-------------------------------------

The bountiful world is under the care of Yahweh himself. He is the master
attendant to the world's growth and sustenance. Yahweh stretches out the heavens
(Psalm 104:2). He laid the foundations of the earth (104:5). He rebukes, and
waters flee, (104:6). He sends the springs into the valleys (104:10). He waters
the hills (104:13). He causes the grass to grow (104:14). He appoints the moon
for seasons (104:19). He makes darkness (104:20).

God as Keeper of the Earth
--------------------------

Yahweh is not a God far away from his earth or people, he's the keeper. Every
morning he's at work like a zookeeper giving each exhibit its food. There he is
handing out food for the lion, armadillo, bee, stork, and beluga whale. He keeps
the sun moving along. Everything waits for Yahweh to provide, even the Leviathan
(104:27). What a world to live in. What a way to look at the world.

Look at the World Biblically
============================

This is how we ought to look at the world. Full of wonder. Full of God's
providence plainly seen. Like a master gardener watering, trimming, singing, and
healing with perfect time. Nothing is out of his sight.

The Naturalist/Secularist Mindset
---------------------------------

There's a chance you would've answered the child by waxing on about the
evaporation cycle. Or the dance of high and low-pressure systems that bring
weather across the earth. There's the temptation to speak of the goings-on of
life on earth like a clock ticking away without an outside source. The
Naturalist Mindset is just that. The world is a machine. The universe is just a
bigger machine that was set in motion. In the far distant future, the clock was
jolted alive by an unknown amount of energy in the Big Bang and it's been
running ever since. But even clocks need to be wound up.

It's everywhere
---------------

This mindset that removes Yahweh from his place and keeper of the earth is
everywhere. Yahweh's people have forgotten Yahweh. This happens because we've
taken our cues from our godless neighbors who want nothing to do with God, all
while enjoying his care. Yahweh and his categories of right and wrong are
removed from public discourse. And there has been fruit from this labor.

Ideas Have Consequences
=======================

The Psalmist's lens and the Naturalist lens are two incompatible ways of looking
at the world. Yes, the Psalmist lens allows us to see how the evaporation cycle
runs, but it is very different from saying the evaporation cycle is all there
is.

Consequences of Naturalism
--------------------------

We do not have to look far to find the consequence of naturalism. Naturalism
look at the world as Richard Dawkins put it, "The universe we observe has
precisely the properties we should expect if there is at bottom, no design, no
purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference." Or as
Stephen Hawking wrote, "the human race is just a chemical scum on a
moderate-sized planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of
one among a hundred billion galaxies. We are so insignificant that I can't
believe the whole universe exists for our benefit." Meaning is not possible with
this lens. Right and Wrong are but preferences without God. Morality is nowhere
to be seen. Death, destruction, and dread follow this sort of lens.

Consequences of the Enchanted Lens
----------------------------------

The enchanted lens of the Psalms brightens our eyes to the world around us.
Everything has meaning. God gave all things a purpose. The sun grows the grass.
The grass feeds the cattle. And cattle feed man. How could the Psalmist not open
and close his words with praising God's majesty and glory (104:1, 35)! The
consequence of this lens is praise to Yahweh, the keeper of the earth. Man's
meditations are sweet because of Yahweh (104:34). Man sings out his years
because of Yahweh's care (104:33).

So, when a 3 or 4-year-old ask where the rains come from, give Yahweh his due.
No baker appreciates it when only the flour, oil, eggs, sugar, and cream are
mentioned when a child asks who made his birthday cake. A baker bakes the cake.
The Rainmaker sends the rain.
