In his 59-page essay, [_The Present Age_](https://amzn.to/2QqCGNg), Soren Kierkegaard criticizes his Danish
culture for being reflective, for being interested in everything and committed
to nothing. The Press is the culprit. It is they who indiscriminately publicize
everything which levels the trivial and the vital. The result is the age of
reflection, where individuals, bursting with enthusiasm, reflect on all the
Press’ abstractions but then suddenly relapses to repose.

To review _The Present Age_, I ask it three questions: What is its argument? Is
it a good argument? And what is its significance today?

## Argument

There are three main ideas which constitute Kierkegaard’s argument: reflection,
the Press, and leveling. _It is the Press who levels everything by its
publications, which results in an indolent age of reflection_.

_Reflection_. Kierkegaard’s argument or critique is that the present age is an
age of reflection. This is in contrast to the other age: the age of
revolution.\[^1\] He writes in his opening line, “Our age is essentially one of
understanding and reflection, without passion, momentarily bursting into
enthusiasm, and shrewdly relapsing into repose” (3).\[^2\] Simply put, nothing
happens anymore except for publicity.

\[^1\]: 

\[^2\]: The translation I will henceforth quote is Alexander Dru’s found in the following publication: _The Present Age: On the Death of Rebellion_ (Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2019).

Reflection is problematic in so far as it stifles action. Imagine, as
Kierkegaard writes, a grown man struggling delightfully in deep waters. He calls
to children ashore, “Come on! Jump in quickly!” Only children, not being worn
out and overburdened by over-reflective thought, will make the existential
decision to jump. The child is willing to exist beside the dangerous, harsh
weather of life. The adult will remain ashore. In this way, reflection stifles
action.

_The Press_. The Press is the culprit of this reflective age. It
indiscriminately reports and propagates information. The Press is sheer
talkativeness; it has no substance. “Nothing ever happens but there is immediate
publicity everywhere.” In publicizing everything, the “indolent mass” becomes
even more displaced as onlookers, bystanders, and gossipers, reinforcing their
reflective passivity (38). The Press is the culprit of the age.

_Leveling_. Having asserted the present age is merely reflective and having
indicted the Press for being indiscriminate, Kierkegaard finally explains why
this indiscriminate coverage leads to reflection. The explanation is wrapped up
in the notion of leveling.

“Leveling” Kierkegaard defines, “is a silent, mathematical, and abstract
occupation which shuns upheavals” (23). Leveling places all things on a level
playing field. Everything is equal. All meaningful differences are lost. The
Press places trivial information and vital information are on the same page.
When meaningful differences are lost, trivial information arrests the attention
of the masses. “Where mere scope is concerned, talkativeness wins the day, it
jabbers on incessantly about everything and nothing” (43). In sum, the Press
levels everything, which results in a reflectively confused and talkative age.

Evaluation

To evaluate _The Present Age_, I consider its validity, style, and persuasion.

_Validity_. Logically, Kierkegaard’s argument is valid: (a) the Press levels,
(b) leveling stifles action, and therefore (c) the Press stifles action. Though
his main argument is logical, there are two questions I have about his
assumptions in his assertion, “Our age is mainly one of… reflection” (3).

First, “reflection” is ambiguous. Is all reflection wrong? Does all reflection
stifle action? Surely not. _The Present Age_ is a call to action and yet,
materially, it is a book which requires reflection. So either his reflection in
_The Present Age_ undermines his own critique on reflection or he is not
criticizing all reflection. I side with the latter. This being so, the question
arises: what kind of reflection is Kierkegaard critiquing?\[^3\]

\[^3\]: Kierkegaard does clarify two-thirds into the book clarify that “reflection is not the evil; but a reflective condition and the deadlock which it involves, by transforming the capacity for action into a means of escape from action, is both corrupt and dangerous, and leads in the end to a retrograde movement” (42). This clarification helps remove some ambiguity but there remains the question: “What kind of reflection is under discussion?”

Second, Kierkegaard assumes “Our age” is distinctly indolent. I disagree.
Neither was his age nor is my age distinctly reflective, rather it is part of
the human condition. Every age deals with the masses who indiscriminately talk
about everything.

_Style_. Kierkegaard’s style is literary and poetic. He defies effortless
reading.\[^4\] To be honest, a few pages eluded my grasp. Yet, I’m convinced this
is a mark of a classic.\[^5\] In short, Kierkegaard is hard to understand but is
worth the effort.

\[^4\]: Paradigmatic of Kierkegaard’s convoluted style is a section from his
_Sickness unto Death_. He writes, “The self is a relation which relates itself
to its own self, or it is that in the relation that the relation relates itself
to its own self; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates
itself to its own self.”

\[^5\]: Mortimer Adler, American philosopher and educator, argued “You must tackle
books that are beyond you, or, as we have said, books that are over your head.
Only books of that sort will make you stretch your mind. And unless you stretch,
you will not learn” in his _How to Read a Book_.

_Persuasion_. Is Kierkegaard persuasive? Three things are necessary for
persuasion: logic, style, and credibility. As I stated above, I think his logic
and style are on point, save a few exceptions, and so I find him persuasive at
large. But what about his character? Is he credible?

First, I have to admit I like Kierkegaard. I find his opinions to be true and I
admire his willingness to go against the grain.

Second, I do believe he is a credible author in so far as he practiced what he
wrote on some things. He didn’t just criticized the Danish Church; he stopped
going to it.

Third, he himself was quite a reflective person. He was a philosopher. This
being so, it creates a tension between his criticism of reflectivity and his
work as a reflective author. To be honest, I struggle to think of anyone more
reflective than Kierkegaard.\[^6\] So while his argument is well made in logic and
style, there is dissonance between the point of the book and the life of the
author.

\[^6\]: For example, Kierkegaard's _Fear and Trembling_ is a philosophical
investigation into the anxiety of Abraham as moved towards murdering his son.
Though I have read few other books by him, it is obvious he is reflective.

## Significance

The beauty of classics is their timelessness. Perhaps _The Present Age_ is even
more relevant in our internet era than it was when it was written.\[^7\]

\[^7\]: For a great application of Kierkegaard’s _The Present Age_ in light of the
internet era see Hubert L. Dreyfus’ “Kierkegaard on the Information Highway” in
UCB Art, Technology, and Culture Colloquim (Berkeley: UC Berkeley, 1997).

Substitute the term “the internet” for “the Press” and contemporary significance
becomes apparent. Just as the Press indiscriminately dumped information on the
public, so too does the internet. For example, 300 hours of video are uploaded
to Youtube every minute \[^8\] And it is undeniable that this video, perhaps all
100% of it, is trivial, non-vital.

_Knowing the difference between the trivial and the vital has never been more
important_.

It is essential that we become proficient essentialists, having a disciplined
pursuit of less in this technological era.\[^9\] John Maxwell said it well, “You
cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything.”\[^10\]

\[^9\]: I recommend the book [_Essentialism_](https://amzn.to/2ZTi6Z0) by Greg McKeown. It argues why and how to be disciplined in one's pursuit of less.

\[^10\]: John Maxwell, [_Developing the Leader Within You_](https://amzn.to/39IiyOn) (Nashville, TN: T.Nelson, 1993), 22-23.

Kierkegaard helps us understand the damning effects of the Press or Internet,
how it levels everything in its path. We need to read less. It was said of
Thomas Hobbes, one of the founders of modern political philosophy and author of
_Leviathan_, that “if he had read as much as other men, he should have known no
more than other men.”\[^11\] Interestingly, reading more books leads to less
knowledge.

\[^11\]: John Aubrey, [_Brief Lives_](https://amzn.to/35mnd5e) (Boydell & Brewer, 1982), 157.

Just as reflection is an escape for adults from jumping into the sea, Christian
reflection, theology can be the escape from practical Christianity.

Kierkegaard’s _The Present Age_ is a criticism against the Press and leveling.
While we cannot regulate what is publicized, we can regulate the amount we read
and what we read. This book is a call to read less, reflect less, and act more.
It is only until we read less that we can jump in and start the revolution which
Christianity was always supposed to be.
