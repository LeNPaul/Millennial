Hello there, </p>
<p  align = "justify">
here is another sum-up note from my lecture. It is probably more useful for me than for you haha, but enjoy it! </p>

### What do we want to get out of the data?
<p  align = "justify">
<i>"The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers." </i>  Richard Hamming, 1962 </p>

### What is insight?
There is no unique definition, but there is a set o characteristics that describes that:
1. Complex
2. Deep
3. Qualitative
4. Unexpected
5. Relevant

<p  align = "justify">
Insight has multiple levels; <b>basic level</b> - a simple fact from the data and <b>top-level</b> - an interpretation from the data that requires reasoning on multiple data sources and domain knowledge, and some intermediate levels between them.
</p>

### What makes a good dataset if you aim for insight?
- <b>high volume</b> - the more data than the more chance that you have something useful
- <b>historical</b> - the more we know the past the better we understand the future
- <b>consistent</b> - keep track of the context to understand the meaning of data
- <b>multivariate</b> - the more variables we have, the richer opportunity we have that we will discover something
- <b>atomic</b> - specify to the lowest level of detail at which something might ever be examined
- <b>clean</b> - information should be accurate, free of error, and complete
- <b>clear</b> - make it easy for yourself and others what data means
- <b>richly segmented</b> - provide and consider several groupings of the data
- <b>of known pedigree</b> - establish the reliability of your sources


### Data guidelines to keep it feasible
1. look inside first 
2. remove the format constraints 
3. figure out what's missing
4. embrace diversity

### ANALYTIC REASONING
<p  align = "justify">
Types of reason: <b>inductive reasoning</b> and <b>deductive reasoning</b>. </p>
<p  align = "justify">
<b>Deductive reasoning</b> -> associated with "formal logic", involves reasoning from known premises, or premises presumed to be true, to a certain conclusion, the conclusions reached are certain, inevitable, inescapable.  => formulate hypotheses about relationships and underlying models, carry out experiments with the data to test hypotheses and models. </p>
<p  align = "justify">
<b>Inductive reasoning</b> -> known as "informal logic", involves drawing uncertain inferences, based on probabilistic reasoning, the conclusions are probable, reasonable, plausible, believable. => explanatory data analysis to discover or refine hypotheses, discover new relationships, insights, and analytic paths from the data. </p>

<p  align = "justify"> <b>
Data Science supports and encourages shifting between deductive (hypothesis-based) and inductive (pattern-based) reasoning.</b></p>


<b>Analytic reasoning artifacts: </b>
- <b>elemental artifacts</b>: artifacts derived from isolated pieces of information
- <b>pattern artifacts</b>: artifacts derived from collections of data
- <b>higher-order knowledge artifacts</b>: logical inferences linking evidence and other reasoning artifacts to greater knowledge value
- <b>complex reasoning constructs</b>: a conjecture explanation, assessment, of forecast that should be supported by the evidence
