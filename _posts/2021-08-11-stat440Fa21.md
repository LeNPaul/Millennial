## <a name="covid-general-information"></a>COVID-19 General Information

Following University policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of the community. Students are also required to follow the campus COVID-19 protocols. 

Students who feel ill must not come to class. In addition, students who test positive for COVID-19 or have had an exposure that requires testing and/or quarantine must not attend class. The University will provide information to the instructor, in a manner that complies with privacy laws, about students in these latter categories. These students are judged to have excused absences for the class period and should contact the instructor via email about making up the work.     

Students who fail to abide by these rules will first be asked to comply; if they refuse, they will be required to leave the classroom immediately. If a student is asked to leave the classroom, the non-compliant student will be judged to have an unexcused absence and reported to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution for disciplinary action. Accumulation of non-compliance complaints against a student may result in dismissal from the University.

### <a name="face-coverings"></a>Face Coverings

All students, faculty, staff, and visitors are required to wear face coverings in classrooms and university spaces. This is in accordance with CDC guidance and University policy and expected in this class.

Please refer to the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaignâ€™s COVID-19 website for further information on face coverings](https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/face-coverings/). Thank you for respecting all of our well-being so we can learn and interact together productively.

### <a name="building-access"></a>Building Access

In order to implement COVID-19-related guidelines and policies affecting university operations, instructional faculty members may ask students in the classroom to show their Building Access Status in the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass. Staff members may ask students in university offices to show their Building Access Status in the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass. If the Building Access Status says "Granted", that means the individual is compliant with the university's COVID-19 policies - either with a university-approved COVID-19 vaccine or with the on-campus COVID-19 testing program for unvaccinated students.

Students are required to show only the Building Access Screen, which shows compliance without specifying whether it was through COVID-19 vaccination or regular on-campus testing. To protect personal health information, this screen does not say if a person is vaccinated or not. Students are not required to show anyone the screen that displays their vaccination status. No university official, including faculty members, may ask students why they are not vaccinated or any other questions seeking personal health information.

## <a name="course-description"></a>Course Description

Statistical Data Management (STAT 440) is a focused data wrangling course that aims to cover various types of data storage, manipulation, cleaning, and extractions and to apply these methodologies in a programming language. The expectation is that students will gain competency in exploring, organizing, designing, creating, storing, cleaning, wrangling, sharing, and using data, all of which are commonly done prior to data analysis. Critical and creative thinking and efficient coding will be encouraged. Concepts covered in this course will build upon each other. Thus, students can expect all assessments to be cumulative. Students should be sufficient and comfortable in one of the two programming languages: R or Python. These languages offer reproducible documentation with Markdown syntax which will support long-term learning opportunities. Git propels students' capacity for collaboration as well as version control of documentation and files.

Because there are two sections of STAT 440 in Fall 2021, readers should assume all information is pertaining to both sections: 1UG/GR (In-person) and OUG/GR (Online). If there are ever differences, note the specific section for that item.

### <a name="instructional-activities"></a>Instructional Activities

**Students should read the course notes, watch the lecture videos, and attempt the assignments. If or when students get stuck, then they should ask questions in the i) Issues Board, ii) Office Hours, or iii) via email (preference in this order).** In addition to lecture videos and office hours, the following activities and tools will be useful for students.


**Course Notes**

The course notes perform the duty of a textbook for this course. Yes, there is a lot of information in the notes, but it is useful to read it for the important parts and return to it for details after attempting the assignments.


**Announcements**

The course announcements page is the landing page within the **stat440-fa21-course-content** repository. This page is a rendering of the README.md file. In this announcements page, students can find a proposed weekly schedule, links to files, information about assignment deadlines, and other important course reminders.


**Issues Board**

This discussion board, which exists as a tab on the **stat440-fa21-course-content** repository, is one of the best ways to communicate with classmates and course staff. Questions can be seen quickly and receive a rapid response. Students are encouraged to use this board, but there is no requirement to participate in the discussion board.

Do use the board to openly discuss ideas about the course as frequently as student likes such as questions about content, deadlines, homework, notes, data, etc. If student specifically wants the course staff to respond, then student should use the mention `@stat440-staff` when posting in the board. The things discussed here should be of a non-personal and non-private matter. If student has a personal or private matter to discuss with the Instructor, please send an email to kinson2@illinois.edu. Additionally, the conversation in the discussion board should be respectful of people's differences and cannot be used to speak negatively about anyone or harm anyone. 

The course staff will view and respond to content on Tuesdays and Thursdays (at a minimum). The course staff can be expected to spend at least 30 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays monitoring the Issues board.

### <a name="assignments"></a>Assignments

**Lab Assignments (section 1UG/GR only)**

These are lab sessions that contain problems for the in-person section only and are due at the end of class. The course location is Room 32 of Psychology building, an iFLEX classroom, which allows for ease of communication, collaboration, and displaying content on large screens at stations. Each week, randomly chosen students ("drivers") will complete the lab assignment, while the remaining students ("passengers") at the stations will help the drivers. From week to week, the lab assignment changes, but students should expect the difficulty for each week's lab assignment to be roughly similar. Lab assignments are intended to push students to apply concepts covered in the course notes and challenge students to work together as a team. Each student must complete three lab assignments as the driver by their respective due dates. Passengers are rewarded for being present and assisting their station's driver. More details about the lab assignments will be discussed in the first two weeks of section 1UG/GR.


**Challenge Assignments (section OUG/GR only)**

These are problems for the online section only. The challenge assignments will be the same for each student and must be submitted on the Course Website by the respective deadlines. These problems are meant to cover several weeks of statistical data management concepts - thereby challenging students on what information they recall and retain. Some questions may require outside-of-the-box thinking, and others may be open-ended. More details about the challenge assignments will be discussed as the deadlines approach.


**Homework Assignments**

These are assignments to be completed by each student as an individual. There will be 5 homework assignments. Students have roughly two weeks to complete and submit each homework. Graduate students are expected to complete all **10** problems, while Undergraduate students are expected to complete the first **8** problems. **Since each assignment is worth 20 points, undergraduate students receive an automatic 4 points if submitted before the homework solutions are posted.** All assigned homework must be submitted on the Course Website by its due date and time. The homework is required for all students. 

"Submitted on the Course Website" means committing and pushing file(s) in the student's own individual repository (or repo for short) within the stat440-fa21 organization in GitHub Enterprise.

Students are encouraged to discuss the homework in the Issues board. However, sharing or copying any part of the homework (including solutions) is an infraction of the University's rules on Academic Integrity. See the syllabus Student Code for more information. The homework problems will be graded for correctness and completeness.

Homework solutions will be shared with students 48 hours after the homework deadline (unless there is an active DRES deadline accommodation). When the homework solution is shared with students, no new submissions for that homework assignment will be accepted. Instead, any assignment submitted after the homework solutions have been posted will receive an automatic grade of 10 points. **This policy above also applies to any students who add the course late to their registration.**

**Late submissions of homework will be accepted, so long as the assignment is submitted before the homework solution is posted. The penalty for any late homework submission is a 4 point deduction.**

**There will be no make-ups for any missed homework. This policy also applies to any students who add the course late to their registration.**

Students can expect that homework will be graded and returned to students within 14 days of the homework deadline. 


**Midterm Exam**

The midterm is one at-home exam. The exam will be (open notes, open book) and take up to 7 days to complete. The midterm must be submitted on the Course Website. The midterm exam will be graded for correctness and completeness.

**Late submissions on any Midterm Exam will not be accepted or graded. There will be no make-ups for any missed Midterm Exam.**

Students can expect the midterm exam to include some, if not all, open-ended questions with no clearly correct solutions. Thus, there will be no solution provided for open-ended questions.


**Final Project**

The Final Project in this course is the creation of a single Shiny app in R that each student must have contributed to the creation of. The final Shiny app will need to be completed (production and testing it out) and successfully working by 11:59 pm Monday December 20, 2021. The collaboration will take place via Git (and GitHub). Each student is expected to make 1 contribution (ideas plus code plus committing and pushing those ideas/code via a pull request) to the app.R file. The contribution is worth 40 points. This Shiny app is an opportunity for students to demonstrate the statistical data management concepts they have learned this semester and apply them along with version control for collaboration. Your ideas and coding must be **your own code**. Details about the Shiny app will be discussed later this semester.
