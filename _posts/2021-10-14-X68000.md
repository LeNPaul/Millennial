The PX68K emulator saw its first release in August 2013 and by then, the PSP homebrew scene had already shrunk to a fraction of its former size. That explains the obscurity of this otherwise solid emulator for the Sharp X68000, a Japanese home computer from the late 1980s.

PX68K is the creation of Hissorii, the Japanese developer who had previously worked on the [NP2 emulator](https://archive.org/details/np-2-for-psp-v-0.39.7z) after its original creator abandoned the project.

### BIOS files

To boot, the emulator requires the following system files to be placed in the `.keropi` folder: 

- iplrom.dat, iplrom30.dat, iplromco.dat, iplromxv.dat

as well as specific font files:

- cgrom.dat, cgrom.tmp

The files are not included in the package. "X68000 emulation files" are good keywords at the moment.

### Loading software

Once the system files are in place, pressing Start will display a loading menu.

For many games, nothing else is required - load the disk (or disks) through the dialog screen, and the game will simply launch.

### Downloading more RAM

Some later X68000 games won't be satisfied with the 1 MB of RAM that the emulator makes available to them as a default. In these cases, the available memory can be bumped up (to a limit of 4 MB, according to the readme) by using Human68k.

Load Human68k like any other floppy-disk program, reset the system and you will be greeted by a sepia GUI.

Press Start to activate mouse movement in the PX68K menu, and select `COMMAND.X`. Once the command-line interface is loaded, press Select to display the on-screen keyboard. Type `switch.x` and press Enter.

Use the arrow keys on the OSK to select `MEMORY`, and increase it to the necessary amount. 2 MB should be enough for most games.

Scroll down to the last line in the menu, press Enter, then Y.

Now the memory-hungrier games should load without error.
