I'm making this list mostly because I lost track of the emulation options myself. As an alternative, there is also the [EmuGen Wiki entry](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulators_on_PSP) about PSP.

Some emulators appear more than once if they support more than one system. RetroArch cores are excluded as they have [their own article](https://psp-archive.github.io/emulators/retroarch-197.html).
