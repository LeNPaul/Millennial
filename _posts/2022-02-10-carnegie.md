This February 18-19, 2022, I will be DJing the 24H DJ Cypher at the Carnegie Hall Afrofuturism Festival! Tune in for two full evenings of Afrofuturism riddims - everything from cosmic techno and hip-hop to reggaeton and dub. See the full schedule at [linktr.ee/24HCypher](https://linktr.ee/24HCypher) and [https://raidfest.com/](https://raidfest.com/).
