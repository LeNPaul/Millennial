On Saturday, April 2, 2022, I will be DJing with my friends Stacey Robinson and Kamau Grantham as **bla(CK)mau** at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (IMC). We're performing outdoors in front of the IMC for Boneyard Arts Festival. The parking lot will be blocked off so people can dance with ample space. Simultaneously, we will be livestreaming on local radio station WRFU 104.5 FM and Twitch. The IMC is also hosting a visual art exhibition that weekend for their indoor art gallery.
