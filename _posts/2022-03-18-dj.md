DJ CK, stylized as "DJCK", Christopher Kinson, Ph. D., is a construction werker spinning music of the African Diaspora that spans the globe fastening the aesthetically unsafe to the safe. His musical inclinations are immediately recognized as Black music from the past, contemporary pop, and futuristic sonics. On his radio program, "The Blackest Hour", he takes listeners on a journey to and from the dance floor. If you see him wearing safety gear, do not be alarmed. For he is busy designing, planning, and building the spiritual movement zone through his uniquely crafted blends and mixes.
