I am one third of **bla(CK)mau**, a artist trio specializing in DJing and event planning. On the first Saturdays of the months September to December, we are hosting Create+Chill at 2-5 pm at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (IMC). Create+Chill is centered around working, creating art, and just hanging out in a coffee shop environment. This space is safe for Black folks and welcoming to everyone, and we encourage all ages including families with children to come through and get some adult talking to another adult time. Someone else maybe works remotely and wants to get a little extra work done, because we know it doesn't always get done Monday-Friday. Maybe an artist wants to finish a piece in the company of other artists. Or someone really just wants to listen and dance to good music curated and spun by fantastic DJs. We have two coffee shops - Caffe Paradiso in Urbana and Mad Goat Coffee in Danville - participating so far. The shops plan on offering free coffee samples and educating the attendees about their specific coffee brews.
