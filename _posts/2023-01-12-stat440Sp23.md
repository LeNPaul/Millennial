## <a name="covid-general-information"></a>COVID-19 General Information

Following University policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of the community. Students are also required to follow the campus COVID-19 protocols. 

If you feel ill or are unable to come to class or complete class assignments due to issues related to COVID-19, including but not limited to testing positive yourself, feeling ill, caring for a family member with COVID-19, or having unexpected child-care obligations, you should contact your instructor immediately, and you are encouraged to copy your academic advisor. 

### <a name="face-coverings"></a>Face Coverings

Face coverings are **strongly recommended** in classrooms during in-person class time, but not required.

University guidance is that face coverings can be recommended but not required, based on current local COVID-19 levels and CDC guidance. This is a very fluid situation and as has been our practice, we will adjust as conditions change. Wearing a face covering remains a personal choice. Please note that students and employees cannot be compelled to wear a face covering.

Please refer to the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's COVID-19 website for further information on face coverings](https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/face-coverings/). Thank you for respecting all of our well-being so we can learn and interact together productively.

## <a name="course-description"></a>Course Description

Statistical Data Management (STAT 440) is a focused data wrangling course that aims to cover various types of data storage, manipulation, cleaning, and extractions and to apply these methodologies in R. **This means that students must have a laptop that they bring to class each day.** This course is not a traditional lecture format. The expectation is that students will gain competency in exploring, organizing, designing, creating, storing, cleaning, wrangling, sharing, and using data, all of which are commonly done prior to data analysis. Critical and creative thinking and efficient coding will be encouraged. Concepts covered in this course will build upon each other. Thus, students can expect all assessments to be cumulative. Students should be sufficient and comfortable in R prior to beginning this course. The RStudio offers reproducible documentation with Markdown syntax which will support long-term learning opportunities. Git propels students' capacity for collaboration as well as version control of documentation and files.

### <a name="instructional-activities"></a>Instructional Activities

**Students should read the course notes, watch the lecture videos, and attempt the assignments. If or when students get stuck, then they should ask questions in the i) Issues Board, ii) Office Hours, or iii) via email (preference in this order).** In addition to lecture videos and office hours, the following activities and tools will be useful for students.


**Course Notes**

The course notes perform the duty of a textbook for this course. Yes, there is a lot of information in the notes, but it is useful to read it for the important parts and return to it for details after attempting the assignments.


**Issues Tab**

This discussion board, which exists as a tab on the **course_content** repository, is one of the best ways to communicate with classmates and course staff. Questions can be seen quickly and receive a rapid response. Students are encouraged to use this board, but there is no requirement to participate in the discussion board.

Do use the board to openly discuss ideas about the course such as questions about content, deadlines, notes, data, etc. If a student specifically wants the course staff to respond, then student should use the mention `@staff` when posting in the board. The things discussed here should be of a non-personal and non-private matter. If student has a personal or private matter to discuss with the Instructor, please send an email to kinson2@illinois.edu. Additionally, the conversation in the discussion board should be respectful of people's differences and cannot be used to speak negatively about anyone or harm anyone. 

The course staff will view and respond to content on Tuesdays and Thursdays (at a minimum). The course staff can be expected to spend at least 30 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays monitoring the Issues.


**Tokens**

Tokens will be used this semester as limited second-chance opportunities to complete assignments without severe penalties. These tokens are intended to help students who could benefit from more opportunities to improve their learning. Each student will be given exactly physical four tokens. Each token may be used to reassess for a grade replacement. This means that a student will take a new version of the assignment such that the new grade will replace the original grade. Tokens are admissible on labs and midterm exams, but inadmissible on piloted practices, final project submissions, and the final exam. One token may be used for a single assignment, but not repeatedly. For example, a student may use one token to reassess on lab01 but not another token to reassess again on lab01. If a student wants to use a token, they must inform the Instructor and return the token during Instructor's office hours within 7 days (i.e. 1 week) of the returned grade of their original assignment. At that time, a reassessment will be provided to the student. If a student returns their unused token(s) at the end of the semester, then 1 point per token is added to overall grade as bonus points. **If a student loses any of their tokens, then no new tokens will be given, and that student forfeits that particular token usage. In other words, without a physical token, students may not benefit from reassessments nor bonus points. The Instructor will distribute tokens to students in Week 03. Students without tokens have until the end of Week 04 to ask the Instructor for the tokens. After Week 04, no new tokens will be distributed to students.** 


**Grade Disputes**

Regarding grade requests and disputes about problems missed on various assignments, please email the Instructor with your requests and disputes within 7 days (i.e. 1 week) of your grade being returned. The dispute will be forwarded to the course staff (TAs/CAs) who will make the final decision about the dispute.


### <a name="assignments"></a>Assignments

**Piloted Practices**

These are guided comprehension assignments to be completed by each student as an individual as late as one hour before their class begins on Mondays. There are 15 piloted practices for the semester but only 10 are required for all students. The shortname for these assignments is PP. They are numbered by their corresponding week number. For example, PP04 corresponds to week 04 piloted practice and is due on Monday of Week 04.

These assignments are to be submitted in the student's repository, which exists within the illinois-stat440 organization in GitHub. See Course Website for web links. These PPs are graded for completion, not correctness. Tokens are inadmissible on these assignments.


**Lab Assignments**

These are lab sessions that contain 4 problems and are due at the end of the class period on Mondays and Wednesdays by the "driver." The course is located in an iFLEX classroom, which allows for ease of communication, collaboration, and displaying content on large screens at stations. Each week (beginning in Week 03), randomly chosen students ("drivers") will complete the lab assignment seated at specified stations, while the remaining students ("passengers") at the stations will help the drivers by giving them ideas and advice on how to complete the problems. Drivers must submit their labs. Passengers are not allowed to type on driver's laptops. All students must bring their laptops to class each day. Lab assignments are intended to push students to apply concepts covered in the course notes and lecture videos and encourage students to work together as a team in a limited amount of time. Each student must complete two lab assignments as the driver by the respective lab due dates. A schedule will be give to students displaying exactly when each student is to be driver and which station number the driver should sit. Do not deviate from this schedule. **Late submissions of lab assignments will not be accepted. There will be no free make-ups for any missed labs. Tokens may be used to reassess when a student misses a lab. This policy applies to any students who add the course late to their registration.** Tokens are admissible on these assignments. Review the Tokens description in above section. 


**Midterm Exam**

The midterms are in-class in-person exams with 10 problems. The exam will be closed notes, closed book. Each midterm file must be submitted on the Course Website via a student's repo. The midterm exam will be graded for correctness and completeness. Students can expect the midterm exam to include a structure similar to lab assignments with a possible mixture of completion, correct/incorrect, and open-ended questions. **Late submissions on any Midterm Exam submission will not be accepted or graded. There will be no make-ups for any missed Midterm Exam submission.** Tokens are admissible on these assignments. Review the Tokens description in above section. 


**Final Exam**

The final exam is one at-home exam with 20 problems. The exam will be open notes, open book and take up to 3 hours to complete. The final exam will be graded for correctness and completeness. Students can expect the final exam to include a structure similar to labs and the midterm exams with a possible mixture of completion, correct/incorrect, and open-ended questions. Students should not expect solutions to be provided for the final exam. **Late submissions on any Final Exam will not be accepted or graded. There will be no make-ups for any missed Final Exam.** Tokens are inadmissible on this assignment. 


**Final Project**

The Final Project in this course is the creation of a single Shiny app or dashboard in R. This Shiny app or dashboard is an opportunity for students to demonstrate the statistical data management concepts covered this semester and apply them along with version control for collaboration. This final project will have two submissions. The Pre-Feedback submission is the group's well-thought-out and successfully running Shiny app or dashboard. The deadline to submit this .R file is April 28. Students will review the feedback from the course staff and incorporate that into the second submission of the Shiny app or dashboard, called the Post-Feedback submission. The deadline to submit this .R file is May 12. Students should read the accompanying grading rubrics for both submissions. Students are allowed to work together on the final project but only in groups of two. If working in groups, a new repo specific to your group will be created in GitHub to permit collaboration. Ideas and coding must be **your own code**. **Late contributions will not be accepted. There will be no make-ups for any missed Final Project.** Tokens are inadmissible on these assignments. **If the group dynamic is not suiting you, notify the Instructor immediately and the group will be split. Thus the two students will now work as individuals each with a new topic for the shiny app or dashboard.**
