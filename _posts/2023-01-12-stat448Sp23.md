## <a name="covid-general-information"></a>COVID-19 General Information

Following University policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of the community. Students are also required to follow the campus COVID-19 protocols. 

If you feel ill or are unable to come to class or complete class assignments due to issues related to COVID-19, including but not limited to testing positive yourself, feeling ill, caring for a family member with COVID-19, or having unexpected child-care obligations, you should contact your instructor immediately, and you are encouraged to copy your academic advisor. 

### <a name="face-coverings"></a>Face Coverings

Face coverings are **strongly recommended** in classrooms during in-person class time, but not required.

University guidance is that face coverings can be recommended but not required, based on current local COVID-19 levels and CDC guidance. This is a very fluid situation and as has been our practice, we will adjust as conditions change. Wearing a face covering remains a personal choice. Please note that students and employees cannot be compelled to wear a face covering.

Please refer to the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's COVID-19 website for further information on face coverings](https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/face-coverings/). Thank you for respecting all of our well-being so we can learn and interact together productively.

## <a name="course-description"></a>Course Description

Advanced Data Analysis (STAT 448) is a mature ad hoc course where data analysis is split into two specialties: interpretation and investigation. Mature ad hoc here means that students are expected to work independently and collaboratively when required, and students will have to do a large amount of reading, a medium amount of coding and discussing ideas, and a small amount of presenting formally. The Instructor will be a facilitator of discussion. This course is not a traditional lecture format. Most learning will happen primarily because of student's own independent reading, collaborative discussions, and coding. Interpretation means that students will learn how to correctly interpret statistical results and visualizations, such as plots, models, and hypothesis tests. Investigation means that students will learn how to complete the Investigative Cycle which includes asking questions, making plans, finding and cleaning data, producing results, and making conclusions which yield more questions. Datasets will be introduced and students will conduct multiple investigative cycles for all datasets throughout the semester. **This means that students must have a laptop that they bring to class each day.** The expectation is that students will gain competency in critical and creative thinking, data exploration, accurate and informed analysis, and presenting analyses in various formats. Students will become proficient data analysts who understand how to explain statistical results as well as how to craft narratives with data. Subjectivity will be applied to assess students' work. Feedback will be given to students and expected to be incorporated into new versions of their work. Students should be sufficient and comfortable in R prior to beginning this course. Students should be familiar with data management and wrangling techniques such as filtering, arranging, mutating, combining, and summarizing data, as well as manipulating strings. The RStudio offers reproducible documentation with Markdown syntax which will support long-term learning opportunities. Git propels students' capacity for collaboration as well as version control of documentation and files. Any existing presentation software will be useful when students need to give presentations.

Read more about data repositories in the Instructional Activities section below.**


### <a name="final-letter-grades"></a>Final Letter Grades

When computing final grades, students can add up their scores on the assignments. The resulting sum will determine which letter grade they earn when the course is completed. **There is only one $+$ letter grade in this course. All other letter grades are without $+/-$. Points are not rounded.**

| Lower bound | Upper bound | Letter grade |

| 0.00 points | 44.999 points | F |

### <a name="instructional-activities"></a>Instructional Activities

**Students should read and review the course content including reference textbooks, articles, notes, and videos. If or when students get stuck, then they should ask questions in the i) in person during class, ii) Issues Board, or iii) Office Hours.** The following activities and tools will be useful for students.


**Discussion**

Students will spend lots of time talking about the data, their analyses, and ideas during class. The Instructor may facilitate specific discussion topics, but the goal is to have space to ask questions, hear thoughts, and share to keep the relevant discussion going. 


**Issues Tab**

This discussion board, which exists as a tab on the **course_content** repository, is one of the best ways to communicate with classmates and course staff. Questions can be seen quickly and receive a rapid response. Students are encouraged to use this board, but there is no requirement to participate in the discussion board.

Do use the board to openly discuss ideas about the course such as questions about content, deadlines, notes, data, etc. If a student specifically wants the course staff to respond, then student should use the mention `@staff` when posting in the board. The things discussed here should be of a non-personal and non-private matter. If student has a personal or private matter to discuss with the Instructor, please send an email to kinson2@illinois.edu. Additionally, the conversation in the discussion board should be respectful of people's differences and cannot be used to speak negatively about anyone or harm anyone. 

The course staff will view and respond to content on Tuesdays and Thursdays (at a minimum). The course staff can be expected to spend at least 30 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays monitoring the Issues.


**Data Repositories**

The data in this course will be hyper-local focusing on Champaign, Urbana, University of Illinois, Champaign County, and the state of Illinois. Each dataset will have its own repository in GitHub such that all students have access to them. Students will conduct analyses on the data, submit their analysis including data preparation and other coding files (in analysis directory) and presentation files (in presentations directory).


**Written Feedback**

Because subjectivity is the foundation of grading, written feedback will be given along with scores based on rubrics. If you do not like the written feedback, please consider what is written as constructive to improve your growth. Practice patience with yourself as you attempt to not take things personally.


### <a name="assignments"></a>Assignments

**Written Reflections**

These are 1-page weekly reflective essays written in Markdown and rendered to .pdf due on Mondays. No images are allowed in the file. No one receives credit for RR01. The reflection is about the student's own growth and development in this course with specific details and structure exhibiting a command of the English language and grammar. These assignments are to be submitted in the student's repository, which exists within the illinois-stat448 organization in GitHub. This repo is named as sp23_stat448_netid. See Course Website for web links.


**Analysis Presentations**

These are formal presentations of your data analysis during class in-person during Weeks 03-08 and Weeks 10-15. Students have roughly 8 minutes to present (as individuals not in groups) with an additional maximum of 2 minutes for questions. Due to this time constraint, the Instructor will always ask the first question post-presentation. Any presentation software such as Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, Node.js, Beamer, Quarto, etc is satisfactory. Any technical troubles with presentation software are the student's responsibility. The course is located in an iFLEX classroom, which allows for ease of communication, collaboration, and displaying content on large screens. All students must bring their laptops to class each day. Each student must complete two analysis presentations by the respective presentation dates. Student analysis files and presentation files must be submitted by the student in the specific dataset's repository in GitHub (in analysis directory and presentation directory, respectively). **There will be no make-ups for any missed presentations. This policy applies to any students who add the course late to their registration.**


**Final Reflective Essay**

The final reflective essay is a maximum 3-page essay written in Markdown and rendered to .pdf and submitted to student's repository in GitHub. This repo is named as sp23_stat448_netid. Line and text spacing should be standard for Markdown. No images are allowed in the file. The reflection is about the student's own growth and development in this course with specific details and structure exhibiting a command of the English language and grammar. This essay is due at 11:59 pm Thursday May 11, 2023. **Late submissions on any Final Reflective Essay will not be accepted or graded. There will be no make-ups for any missed Final Reflective Essay.**
