I along with my collaborators, Kamau Grantham and Stacey Robinson, are published in The Black Theatre Review in that journal's Artistic Practice as Scholarship section. [We are bla(CK)mau](https://weareblackmau.github.io/presents/) and our work dwells in afrofuturism and black speculative arts. This piece, bla(CK)mau Xperience, is a video with music.
