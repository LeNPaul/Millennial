## 2023 CU Folk and Roots Festival includes Fela Fest 2023
This year Fela Fest is included as part of the [CU Folk and Roots Festival](https://folkandroots.org/). DJ KamamaMau and I plan to play as much of Fela's afrobeat music as possible in two hours. We also hope to play music influenced by Fela Kuti and those songs that obviously sample Fela Kuti's music. This should be a fun, family-friendly event that is welcoming to everyone, especially Chambana's Black and African populations. Dance to the rhythms. Feel the spirits. Enjoy yourselves!
