## An incredible experience

The inaugural Peregrina event surpassed all expectations, emerging as an incredible and unforgettable experience for all 23 participants. From the moment we embarked on the journey, traversing a remarkable distance of approximately 600 kilometers in just 52 hours, the adventure unfolded across diverse landscapes, both day and night. The sense of autonomy and the unique challenges faced during the run fostered a deep connection among the participants, creating lasting memories and a strong bond.

## How to get you involved 

The camaraderie extended beyond the running trails to the shared van life experience. Divided into three campers, each accommodating 7 individuals, including three couples of runners and a dedicated driver, the van became a hub of laughter, stories, and mutual support. The end party at the conclusion of the run provided the perfect culmination to the event, offering a space for collective celebration and reflection on the shared accomplishment.
