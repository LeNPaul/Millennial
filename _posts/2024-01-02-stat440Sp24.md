## <a name="course-description"></a>Course Description

Statistical Data Management (STAT 440) is a focused data wrangling course that aims to cover various types of data storage, manipulation, cleaning, and extractions and to apply these methodologies in R. **This means that students must have a laptop that they bring to class each day.** This course is not a traditional lecture format. Most lecture content will be distributed in video form at the beginning of the semester. Notes are reproducible documents that include examples and code. Videos and notes should be read and understood before (and outside of) class. The classroom space and time will be for application, practice, and assessment of course content in those videos and notes. The expectation is that students will gain competency in exploring, organizing, designing, creating, storing, cleaning, wrangling, sharing, and using data, all of which are commonly done prior to data analysis. Critical and creative thinking and efficient coding will be encouraged. Concepts covered in this course will build upon each other. Thus, students can expect all assessments to be cumulative. An autograder is used to grade assignments. Students should be sufficient and comfortable in R prior to beginning this course. The RStudio offers reproducible documentation with Markdown syntax which will support long-term learning opportunities. Git propels students' capacity for collaboration as well as version control of documentation and files.

### <a name="instructional-activities"></a>Instructional Activities

**Students should read the course notes, watch the lecture videos, and attempt the assignments. If or when students get stuck, then they should ask questions in the i) Issues Board, ii) Office Hours, or iii) via email (preference in this order).** In addition to lecture videos and office hours, the following activities and tools will be useful for students.


**Course Notes**

The course notes perform the duty of a textbook for this course. Yes, there is a lot of information in the notes, but it is useful to read it for the important parts and return to it for details after attempting the assignments.


**Issues**

This discussion board, which exists as a tab on the **course_content** repository, is one of the best ways to communicate with classmates and course staff. Questions can be seen quickly and receive a rapid response. Students are encouraged to use this board, but there is no requirement to participate in the discussion board.

Do use the board to openly discuss ideas about the course such as questions about content, deadlines, notes, data, etc. If a student specifically wants the course staff to respond, then student should use the mention `@staff` when posting in the board. The things discussed here should be of a non-personal and non-private matter. If student has a personal or private matter to discuss with the Instructor, please send an email to kinson2@illinois.edu. Additionally, the conversation in the discussion board should be respectful of people's differences and cannot be used to speak negatively about anyone or harm anyone. 

The course staff will view and respond to content on Tuesdays and Thursdays (at a minimum). The course staff can be expected to spend at least 30 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays monitoring the Issues.


**Grade Disputes**

Please email the Instructor with your requests and disputes within 7 days (i.e. one week) of your grade being returned for a specific assignment.


### <a name="assignments"></a>Assignments

**Piloted Practices**

These are guided comprehension assignments to be completed by each student as an individual before the class begins on Mondays. There are 14 piloted practices for the semester. The shortname for these assignments is pp. They are numbered by their corresponding week number. For example, pp04 corresponds to week 04 piloted practice and is due on Monday of Week 04.

These assignments are to be submitted in main branch of the student's repository inside of the piloted-practices directory, which exists within the illinois-stat440 organization in GitHub. See Course Website for web links. These pp's are graded for completion, not correctness. However, the code must follow reproducibility guidelines and must not contain executable errors or warnings.


**Lab Assignments**

These are lab sessions that contain 4 problems and are due at the end of the class period on Mondays and Wednesdays by the "driver." The course is located in an iFLEX classroom, which allows for ease of communication, collaboration, and displaying content on large screens at stations. Each week (beginning in Week 04), randomly chosen students ("drivers") will complete the lab assignment seated at specified stations, while the remaining students ("passengers") at the stations will help the drivers by giving them ideas and advice on how to complete the problems. Drivers must submit their labs. Passengers are not allowed to type on driver's laptops. All students must bring their laptops to class each day. Lab assignments are intended to push students to apply concepts covered in the course notes and lecture videos and encourage students to work together as a team in a limited amount of time. Each student must complete two lab assignments as the driver by the respective lab due dates. A schedule will be given to students displaying exactly when each student is to be driver and which station number the driver should sit. Students should not deviate from this schedule. **Late submissions of lab assignments will not be accepted. There will be no make-ups for any missed labs. This policy applies to any students who add the course late to their registration.**


**Midterm Exam**

Each midterm exam contains 10 problems and is in-class and in-person. The exam will be closed notes, closed book. Each midterm file must be submitted on the Course Website via a student's repo. The midterm exam will be graded for correctness and completeness. Students can expect the midterm exam to include a structure similar to lab assignments with a possible mixture of completion, correct/incorrect, and open-ended questions. **Late submissions on any Midterm Exam submission will not be accepted or graded. There will be no make-ups for any missed Midterm Exam submission. There is one Reassessment Midterm Exam for each original Midterm Exam to give students who struggle with the original Midterm Exam submission a second opportunity to review course content and improve their score: Reassessment Midterm Exam 1 and Reassessment Midterm Exam 2. The Reassessment Midterm Exams take place on the Friday following the original Midterm Exam. The Reassessment Midterm Exam grade may be used to replace the original Midterm Exam grade, for the respective exam number. For example, a student's Reassessment Midterm Exam 1 grade of 10 points may only be used to replace the grade of the original Midterm Exam 1 grade of 0 points. All exams (original or reassessment) are in-person exams. For students who do not wish to take the reassessment, they may use the reassessment exam date as a study at home day.** 


**Final Exam**

The final exam is one in-person exam with 20 problems. The exam will be open notes, open resources, and take up to 3 hours to complete. The final exam will be graded for both correctness and completeness. Students can expect the final exam to include a structure similar to labs and the midterm exams with a possible mixture of completion, correct/incorrect, and open-ended questions. Students should not expect solutions to be provided for the final exam. **Late submissions on any Final Exam will not be accepted or graded. There will be no make-ups for any missed Final Exam.** 


**Final Project**

The Final Project in this course is the creation of a single Shiny app or dashboard in R. This Shiny app or dashboard is an opportunity for students to demonstrate the statistical data management concepts covered this semester and apply them along with version control for collaboration. The final project requires students to work in groups of 2 members only. Individual final projects will be considered only if there is an odd number of enrolled students and/or there is conflict within an existing group. 

The final project will have two submissions and both submissions must be a single .R file; no other file extension will be permitted. The Pre-Feedback submission is the group's well-thought-out and successfully running Shiny app or dashboard. The deadline to submit this .R file is April 26. Students will review the feedback from the course staff and incorporate that into the second submission of the Shiny app or dashboard, called the Post-Feedback submission. The deadline to submit this new .R file is May 10. 

Students should read the accompanying grading rubrics for both submissions. A new repo specific to the student's group will be created by the Instructor in GitHub to permit collaboration. Groups must consist of students in the same section; no cross-section collaboration. Ideas and coding must be **your own code**. **Late contributions will not be accepted. There will be no make-ups for any missed Final Project. If there is group conflict, notify the Instructor immediately so that the group will be split. Thus the two students will now work as individuals each with a new topic (different from original group's topic) for the shiny app or dashboard.**

The Shiny dashboard must contain data directly accessed from an API. The app (or dashboard) must contain an actionbutton (or submitbutton) allowing the user to click it such that clicking this button triggers the app (or dashboard) to show results. Any change the user makes, such as selecting variables and specific options, should not cause the app (or dashboard) to show new results. Instead, the app or dashboard should only show new results when the actionbutton (or submitbutton) is clicked. The results must include at least 1 data visualization and at least 1 summary table or summary tibble returned. A summary table or tibble is one that computes a new statistic based on by-group processing.


The Pre-Feedback grading rubric is (maximum total of 13 points):

|  | **Needs Much Improvement 3** | **Satisfactory 4** | **Impressive 5** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Functionality 1** | The app (or dashboard) lacks much functionality. The buttons, selections, and options do not work properly. The app (or dashboard) completely disregards instructions. | The app (or dashboard) contains reasonable functionality. The buttons, selections, and options do work properly. The app (or dashboard) follows the instructions. | The app (or dashboard) incorporates much functionality and runs smoothly without hiccups. The buttons, selections, and options work precisely, quickly, and with fantastic efficiency. The app (or dashboard) completely follows the instructions and goes above and beyond to deliver impressive performance. |
| **Beauty 1** | The app (or dashboard), data visualization, and summary table used are least visually appealing and have minimally readability rendering them not easily interpretable. The app (or dashboard) incorporates almost no visual design principles. | The app (or dashboard), data visualization, and table used are commonly visually appealing and have decent readability rendering them moderately interpretable. The presentation incorporates a few visual design principles. | The app (or dashboard), data visualization, and table used are most visually appealing and have superior readability rendering them quickly and completely interpretable. The presentation incorporates several visual design principles. |
| **Minimum requirements met 0.6** | No minimum requirements are met. Submission ignores all requirements detailed in instructions. | At least one but not all minimum requirements are met. Submission ignores some requirements detailed in instructions. | All minimum requirements are met. Submission ignores none of the requirements detailed in instructions. |


The Post-Feedback grading rubric is (maximum total of 4 points):

Category | Points
---|---
Feedback was incorporated to improve the Functionality of dashboard  | 0 (disagree), 1 (unclear), 2 (agree)
Feedback was incorporated to improve the Beauty of dashboard | 0 (disagree), 1 (unclear), 2 (agree)

**Maximum Total Final Project is 17 points.**

### <a name="autograder"></a>Autograder

The code we write in this course must be reproducible. It is important that code does not contain executable errors and warnings. Submitting code with executable errors and warnings shows that a student is not following one of the course learning objectives. Submitting error-producing code also shows that there is no regard for what reproducibility means. There is an autograder used in this course to grade assignments. The autograder is not forgiving. It will scan the entire file and check for base R executable errors and warnings as well as grade the assignment for correctness and completion. Objects created at the top of the file which are overwritten at the bottom of the file will be considered incorrect by the autograder. When the autograder detects a base R executable error or warning, it will stop grading the student's submission and assign a grade of 0 for the assignment. 

To follow reproducible coding guidelines and prevent executable errors and warnings, be sure to do the following (in no particular order):

1. Save the file with the correct name. Your netid should replace anything saying 'netid'.

2. Save the file in the correct location. `pp**` assignments belong directly in the **piloted-practices** directory of your repo on the main branch. All `lab**` assignments belong directly in the **labs** directory of your repo on the main branch. All `exam**` belongs in the **exams** directory of your repo on the main branch. Any sub-directories within these directories is inappropriate.

3. Explicitly write code that attaches or loads a package using either `library()` or environment call `package_name::` if you use a package to produce your result.

4. Change your RStudio Global Options's General Tab such that:  
  - Restore most recently opened project at startup is **not checked**.  
  - Restore previously open source documents at startup is **not checked**.  
  - Restore .RData into workspace at startup is **not checked**.  
  - Save workspace to .RData on exit is **Never**.  
  - Always save history (even when not saving .RData) is **not checked**.  

5. Change your RStudio Global Options's Code Tab such that Under the Saving section:  
  - Always save R scripts before sourcing is **not checked**.  
  - Automatically save when editor loses focus is **not checked**.  
  - When editor is idle is **Do nothing**.  
  
6. Restart your R session. This can be done in RStudio using the Session > Restart R. After clicking this, if your session still shows objects in the Environment, then click Session > Terminate R > Yes. Terminating the R session effectively does the same thing that restarting the R session should do: detach any packages and remove all objects in the global environment giving you a new session.

7. After beginning a new session, execute and run all your code to ensure there are no executable errors or warnings. Some warnings are specific to a package which may not cause R executable errors or warnings.

8. Comment out any erratic code using the hashtag symbol `#`. Doing so will prevent the autograder from executing it. This is useful if you don't know how to correct your errors or warnings before the deadline.

9. Comment out or remove any `install.packages()` in your code chunks.

10. Do not work with local files or any files that exist only on your computer. Data objects and data files must be accessed with URLs (provided by the Instructor).

### <a name="disability-accommodations"></a>Disability Accommodations

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, student may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603, e-mail disability@illinois.edu or go to the DRES website at http://disability.illinois.edu/

### <a name="academic-integrity"></a>Academic Integrity and Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools

It is expected that all students abide by the campus regulations on academic integrity http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html.

Generative artificial intelligence tools are relatively new to the general public and can be useful in learning and studying. If students use generative AI tools in this course, do so outside of class as a means of studying and learning accurate information relevant to this course's content. Students should not use generative artificial intelligence tools as a means to perform (on graded assignments and submissions) in this course. Doing so is an intentional violation of academic integrity.

The University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct to the University's Title IX and Disability Office. In turn, an individual with the Title IX and Disability Office will provide information about rights and options, including accommodations, support services, the campus disciplinary process, and law enforcement options. 

A list of the designated University employees who, as counselors, confidential advisors, and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found at https://wecare.illinois.edu/resources/students/#confidential. Other information about resources and reporting is available at https://wecare.illinois.edu.
