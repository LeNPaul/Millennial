<h1>About Graphite</h1>
<p>Graphite is an online at press dedicated to providing thoughtful essays on God, his word, and how to serve him. While each writer has his own interests, all of them are under the domain of striving to please God with all that we had. </p>
<p>Graphite started as an idea after Dan came back from his 3 year stay in Romania. We wanted to do something together, but the fact that we all live in different parts of the States , we decided to take this online. So, here we are. </p>
<p>Every week you can expect to see new article. Although, the best way to get updates is to sign up at the bottom of this page with your email and we will send you an article every time it's published. </p>
