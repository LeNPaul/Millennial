During the next adventure, athlets will face the difficulties imposed by Alps. Sorrounded by magnificent panorama and astonishing natural landscapes, the runners will climb thousands of meters running over world wide known Alps passes, like Stelvio Pass. The journey will start from Milan, unforgettable starting point of the first edition. The athlets will then cross entirely the Adda river National Park, observing birds and historical buildings all along the way. They will reach Lecco, at the roots of the Alps, where the real fatigue begin. A preliminary test will be set by the Valsassina, a still quite rural area, sorrounded by magnificent peaks of calcar rocks, shaped along thousands of years into chimney and steep tips. The last section of the vally is a downrun towards Como Lake, along which about 50 kilometers of old wonderful villages will be crossed. The hearth of the Alps is not far. Valtellina, one of the longest and most beautiful Alps valley will be the set of the run for about 200 km till reaching the bottom of the stelvio Pass. Here 20 km and 2000 meters of elevation will demolish the athlets, forcing them to run on steep section while temperature will drop from 30 degrees down to 5. The following is like dreaming. Athlets will enter Trentino Alto Adige, home of the Dolomites, unique mountains, known all over the world for their unique shape and colors. Here, still with about 200 km to go, athlets will admire the widest known Dolomite section, from Bolzano to Misurina and Cortina, to finally reach Belluno, where an organised AfterParty will wait for them.
